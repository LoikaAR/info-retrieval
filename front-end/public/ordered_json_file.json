The Trail offers an exhilarating hike from B\u00f6nigen via Iseltwald to Brienz. Depending on your physical fitness, the entire hike can be made in one piece or in several stages. The first section leads to the light-flooded Eschwanden waterfall. Following a wide forest trail you reach the hamlet of Fura and about 1 km further on, the fishing village of Iseltwald. After a short walk you reach the M\u00fclibach Falls - a wonderful, mystic spot above Iseltwald. You hike along a well maintained hiking trail through a forest, then across open fields with views of Lake Brienz to reach the impressive Giessbach Falls, which cascade over 14 steps into Lake Brienz. You can also walk along a forest path to the Engi postbus stop above the hotel, from where you can walk down the Axalpstrasse to Lake Brienz.

As you hike towards the valley, you'll enjoy views of the Bernese Alps and their glaciers as well as the Central Swiss peaks including Mount Titlis, the Stanserhorn, and Mounts Mythen, Rigi and Pilatus. Equally splendid: emerald-green Lake Lungern, a paradise for fishing enthusiasts.  The path is lined with an abundance of flora and fauna thanks to traditional and ecological cultivation by the mountain farmers. The hike passes through a plant conservation zone. Over 100 species of diurnal butterflies flit about on the dry grassland, including many rare and protected species. 17 information panels along the path describe the most striking types, with information about the butterflies, their development and distribution, and also about the plant world and the landscape structures. The largest numbers of butterflies can be observed between June and August.  Other rare insects and plants also feel very much at home on these sunlit slopes. Over 20 varieties of orchids and lilies can be found here between the end of May and mid-October. If you set out in the early morning hours, you'll have the best chances of spotting ibex, chamois, stags, roe deer or even eagles.

One highlight follows another, from the Greina Plateau to the passes and lake landscape at the foot of the Dents du Midi. Clearly it\u2019s not likely that all stages will be covered at one time \u2013 but it can be hiked in sections. One major advantage of hiking the passes is the opportunity to leave or join the route in any valley between two passes. And once you\u2019ve trodden the entire route \u2013 you can claim that you\u2019ve looked deep into the soul of the Graubunden and Valais mountain world."

The hike starts on Solalex plateau, located at the end of a valley basin at the foot of the Diablerets massif and the impressive Miroir d'Argentine: this shimmering silver rock wall, literally smooth as a mirror, is a classic for all mountaineers. It is actually a fossilised coral reef, once submerged in the primeval Tethys Sea (200 million years ago) \u2013 as plenty of fossils attest. This is one of Switzerland's most famous climbing walls, spanning multiple rope lengths. You then hike uphill towards Anzeinde on mostly broad paths. If you listen carefully, you'll hear the marmots whistling as you arrive. Farmed since the 13th century, this Alpine meadow is located on a broad high plain above the tree line. From here, you have a stunning view of the steep rock faces beneath the glaciated Diablerets group of mountains. Look up to admire the Alpine view \u2013 and from here on, the hike itself becomes increasingly Alpine. It takes you to Col des Essets pass, which you cross.    After descending through a valley to Alp La Vare, the route climbs again via Sur Champ to La Motte. You need to be sure-footed on this section, which is more challenging in a couple of places. On reaching the top, an enchanting view of the Rhone and Lake Geneva opens up. Then comes a somewhat steeper descent to Solalex, where the hike started. At one difficult point, the path is secured with chains but otherwise, the going is good.

        "description": "Idyllic landscapes and impressive glass art: The stained glass trail through the hilly green Glane district offers hikers and art enthusiasts a chance to admire the well-preserved stained glass windows of the pretty chapels and churches. The starting point of the circular hike is the attractive medieval town of Romont. The technically easy hike starts at the  , the Swiss Museum of Stained Glass and Glass Art.\u00a0The museum is located in Romont castle, from where a steps lead down to the river Gl\u00e2ne. The district takes its name from the river. After about half an hour, you pass the small chapel of Sainte-Anne before continuing slightly uphill for another 30 minutes towards M\u00e9zi\u00e8res. In the   of this small village, you can admire the abstract stained glass by Yoki on the 34 windows and visit the   in the castle of M\u00e9zi\u00e8res. The trail then descends along fields and through a short section of forest to La Neirigue. The hamlet is located by the stream of the same name and is home to the Chapelle de La Neirigue. The chapel, built in 1641, is also worth a visit with its pretty stained glass windows. Continue to Grangettes-Pr\u00e8s-Romont, where the   can be visited. The slightly elevated place of the church offers a wonderful wide view over the idyllic landscape of the Glane district. From here, the hike takes you back to La Neirigue along the same path (about an hour in total).  : If you want to shorten the hike, leave St. Moritz church and start on the way back already in La Neirigue. On the way back, the hike first leads slightly uphill for about 20 minutes to Berlens, where the   has been attracting pilgrims since the Middle Ages. The small church delights with its colourful windows that depict, among other things, the times of the church year. Before admiring the next stained-glass windows, it is worth making a short stop in front of the hamlet of Mottex. From here the view of Romont and the hilly surroundings is particularly beautiful.

It offers breathtaking views over Lenk village and to the surrounding mountain world and leads past the most spectacular cascades in the Simmental. The hike starts with an ascent in the forest and continues along the Simmen falls to the first highlight: the Barbara bridge. From here, the stormy Simmen falls can not only be seen and heard, but also felt on one's own body in the form of water splashes. Here, masses of water cascade over the rocks and envelop the surroundings in mist. The bridge or dam in front of the waterfall serves as a barrier to divert the rising Simme. This measure was taken as early as the late 18th century to protect the valley from flooding. Barbara was the name of the wife of the Kurhaus director at the time, who made it possible to open up the Simmen falls and the barrage to tourists.  The route then winds its way up through the forest. Deep gorges can be observed, chiselled into the rock by the Simme. Before reaching Alp Rezlibergli, the terrain becomes somewhat more level, but the hike is all the more exhilarating as you detour to the seven springs of the Simme. At the foot of a mighty limestone wall, the Simme foams to the surface. In summer, up to 2800 litres per second flow from the seven springs. This fascinating natural spectacle and the surrounding mountain meadows with fireplaces invite you to linger.  The second ascent is another strenuous one. The highest point of the hike is reached at the historic Langermatte, where, according to legend, the \"women\u2019s battle\" was once fought. Today you\u2019ll find an alpine cheese dairy here; another follows on Alp Ritz. From Langermatte via alpine pastures, Iffigenalp is reached all too quickly. At the end of the hike, a sun terrace awaits you in the stately Berghaus. Tip: On your return to the village of Lenk, you pass the Iffig waterfall.

Running through two linguistic regions, the long trail boasts extensive views and the discovery of a varied landscape. A respite from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and mass tourism.\n The Jura Crest Trail is the oldest long-distance hike in Switzerland. Signposting on the route \u2013 starting at Zurich and ending just before Geneva \u2013 began as early as 1905. It is a long-distance hike that links two major Swiss towns, and as the name suggests, leads over the heights of the Swiss Jura. This makes a sweeping arc towards the northwest, so those hiking this trail go a little round the bend \u2013 and over the linguistic border. \n \nThe route has a particular appeal, as it\u2019s always easy to keep track of. Later, it offers far-ranging views of the Alps, Black Forest and the Vosges. Along the way, hikers encounter craggy cliffs and deep ravines, springs and lakes with no visible outlets, tranquil forests and extensive meadows as well as all manner of flora and fauna. Similarities aside, many regional differences are waiting to be discovered: different styles of house and village, or cuisines with distinctive tastes. The many mountain restaurants and m\u00e9tairies are ideal for sampling local specialities."

They provide comprehensive information on the causes and consequences of glacier melt in the alpine region. Timetables illustrate how the glacier has retreated since 1850. Further information can also be found in the book \"Lebendiges Gletschervorfeld\". The descent first follows the same path, then turns right and leads through sparse larch forest back to the starting point. On this easy hike, children are accompanied by the mountain spirit Sabi.

The Morteratsch glacier is the largest glacier of the Bernina group. The starting point of this hike is the Morteratsch station of the Rhaetian railway near Pontresina. Immediately after the railway crossing, you can take the turnoff towards the Boval hut. After a short ascent, you reach the Ch\u00fcnetta viewpoint next to the trail which offers close-up views of the mighty glacier streams and impressive peaks. The focus of the tour is the vegetation found on the glacier forefield and the signposted glacier theme trail to the Morteratsch glacier which includes 16 stations. They provide comprehensive information on the causes and consequences of glacier melt in the alpine region. Timetables illustrate how the glacier has retreated since 1850. Further information can also be found in the book \"Lebendiges Gletschervorfeld\". The descent first follows the same path, then turns right and leads through sparse larch forest back to the starting point. On this easy hike, children are accompanied by the mountain spirit Sabi. They are given the booklet \"Sabi's big dream\" with a story and tasks (available in the letterbox at the start, in most hotels in Pontresina, at the tourism office, etc.). The tasks can be solved on the hike and stamps are also collected. Those who have collected all the stamps and solved the riddle will receive a small surprise gift at the tourism office in Pontresina"

The paths reflect various shades of green while the traditional dry stone walls blend harmoniously into the landscape. The pastures are dotted with stones of bizarre shapes. Since you are hiking in a nature reserve, dogs should be kept on a leash and you should not leave the paths.  A first highlight of the loop tour is the beautiful Creux du Croue, a 150-metre-deep basin with peat bog soil. Especially in autumn, the change of colours is lovely. The valley incision was probably formed first by erosion, then by constant washing out below the surface. A sheep pen sits in the middle.  The ascent to the small peak of Le Noirmont is technically easy, but it drags on.

It takes us across one of the valley's largest alpine pastures, through larch forests and above the tree line to two lakes close to the Italian border. Do you know the lake Lagh da Saoseo in the Val da Camp? Then it's time to discover the Lagh da la Regina and the Lagh dal Mat as well. They are located in the somewhat lesser-known Val dal Saent valley, which is bordered by the Piz Combul hills. They are the two largest of a total of seven lakes that the ice-age glacier formed here in the rocky soils. However, up to three of the very small lakes dry out completely in summer.  The tour starts at the Alpe Pescia Bassa which can be reached by bus (on-demand system) from Cavaione. The trail first climbs up through a larch forest to the clearing of the Alp Li Piani. Continuing along the tree line, you reach the first lake of the hike, the Lagh dal Mat. This is also the highest point of the hike close to the Italian border. The next stop is the smaller Lagh da la Regina.  From here, the route descends to the Col d'Anzana mountain pass. The flat crossing offers a fantastic panorama and is also the borderline between Switzerland and Italy. It connects the Valposchiavo with Teglio in the Valtellina. Further down you arrive at the houses of Pescia Alta, the largest alp in the Valposchiavo.

        "description": "This interesting hike leads past unique and unspoilt scenery typical to the Jura region with its gorges, woods, meadows and rocky faces. Following far-reaching views seen from the Belchenflue and decent through woods and meadows, Olten invites you to stop for a pause along the River Aare. Starting point for this hike is H\u00e4gendorf, one of the industrial towns in the G\u00e4u region. Here where the unbridled Cholersbach cut its way through the Jura rock, steep rocky faces, caves, caverns and most unusual rock formations are the result. The path winds its way along the wild stream passing almost surreal moss covered cliffs and the natural Spitzbrunnen fountain.   Continuing the decent, the path leads to the Gwidemh\u00f6chi and elevated Belchenflue. From here you have amazing views as far as the Alps, and the Schwarzwald woods Jura chain and Vogesen on the other side.   As you continue your downward path, on through woods and meadows, you then pass the General-Wille House on the way to Hombergl\u00fccke, followed by the Rumpelh\u00f6chi and Rumpel. And before you know it, your Olten destination comes into view."

Engiloch is situated halfway between the Simplon pass and Simplon village and is a popular starting point for hikes. At first on relatively even terrain, this tour leads past larches to the Chluismatta alpine hut. Here you can taste local products (by appointment). Then the ascent begins: following the left side of the Ritzibach, you climb up the slope to Wysse Bode (2113 m). From here you enjoy a beautiful view of the waterfall, which you are now walking towards.  The trail then leads through a steep slope to a rock ledge. This part is secured with a rope. Steps carved into the stone also help with the ascent. The rocky terrain is overcome on the left side of the waterfall via a ramp. Behind it, somewhat hidden in a scree hollow: the crystal-clear Sirwoltu lake, which is dammed by a mighty moraine. Situated between Galehorn and B\u00f6shorn, it invites you to take a break. Afterwards, concentration and stamina are once again required: the trail climbs uphill over a steep scree slope to the highest point of the tour.

In just a few minutes, the cable car (operating from June to October) takes you from the village of Rodi-Fiesso right up to the Tremorgio hut (1850 meters): a 900 metre ascent which allows you to save a lot of energy. On reaching the top, you will be offered a fabulous view of the lake whose waters have been used for nearly a century to produce electricity. In autumn 2012, the Carlo Danzi Foundation promoted and funded the construction of a trail that allows you to walk around the lake: an easy, 3-km hike along flat ground, which takes about 40 minutes. Local products and hot meals can be enjoyed at the hut during the summer. On the other hand the vast plain of Alpe Campolungo (2100 metres), crossed by a crystal-clear stream, can be reached in less than an hour\u2019s walk from the cable car arrival station. An idyllic place, rich in minerals, studied by many researchers. During summer, the meadows abound in lush vegetation, and flowering shrubs add a touch of colour to the landscape. Here you can admire gentians, anemones, rhododendrons, buttercups, columbines as well as many other flowering species. While climbing up to Lake Le\u00ect (\u201cLe\u00ect\u201d meaning \"small lakes\" in Leventina dialect), which can be reached in about 45 minutes, the pasture gives way to rock. The landscape changes appearance and is dominated by the magnificent Pizzo Prevat silhouetted against the sky. It is a much-loved summit often tackled by mountain climbers who test their skills on this demanding ascent. The Leit Hut is the perfect place to take a pit stop, enjoying simple dishes including polenta served with regional alpine cheeses. Hikers will have to walk for another 45 minutes along a fairly steep, rather challenging path, before coming upon another hidden treasure, namely Lake Varozzeira (2400 metres), boasting a beautiful, almost purple colour.  Overall, allow about two hours to get to Lake Le\u00ect from Tremorgio (just under three hours to Lake Varozzeira). Anyone wishing to try their hand at a more challenging hike, or stay in the area overnight, can take the three-and-a-half hour climb up to the Campo Tencia Hut (the first hut built in the Ticino Alps, it was opened in 1912) and the eponymous Pizzo Campo Tencia, which, standing at a height of 3701 metres, is the highest peak in the Ticino area (calculate around 3 hours from the hut) Inaugurated in the summer of 2016, the geo-tourism trail of Campolungo comprises two routes, a flatter one skirting Lake Tremorgio, and a more challenging one that leads to the Leit Hut.

        "description": "\n                                The hike to the Tremorgio and Le\u00ect alpine lakes in  \n                                 The hike to the Tremorgio and Le\u00ect alpine lakes above Rodi-Fiesso (940 meters) in Leventina Valley is a particularly fascinating excursion for those who love alpine environments. In just a few minutes, the cable car (operating from June to October) takes you from the village of Rodi-Fiesso right up to the Tremorgio hut (1850 meters): a 900 metre ascent which allows you to save a lot of energy. On reaching the top, you will be offered a fabulous view of the lake whose waters have been used for nearly a century to produce electricity. In autumn 2012, the Carlo Danzi Foundation promoted and funded the construction of a trail that allows you to walk around the lake: an easy, 3-km hike along flat ground, which takes about 40 minutes. Local products and hot meals can be enjoyed at the hut during the summer. On the other hand the vast plain of Alpe Campolungo (2100 metres), crossed by a crystal-clear stream, can be reached in less than an hour\u2019s walk from the cable car arrival station. An idyllic place, rich in minerals, studied by many researchers. During summer, the meadows abound in lush vegetation, and flowering shrubs add a touch of colour to the landscape. Here you can admire gentians, anemones, rhododendrons, buttercups, columbines as well as many other flowering species. While climbing up to Lake Le\u00ect (\u201cLe\u00ect\u201d meaning \"small lakes\" in Leventina dialect), which can be reached in about 45 minutes, the pasture gives way to rock. The landscape changes appearance and is dominated by the magnificent Pizzo Prevat silhouetted against the sky. It is a much-loved summit often tackled by mountain climbers who test their skills on this demanding ascent. The Leit Hut is the perfect place to take a pit stop, enjoying simple dishes including polenta served with regional alpine cheeses. Hikers will have to walk for another 45 minutes along a fairly steep, rather challenging path, before coming upon another hidden treasure, namely Lake Varozzeira (2400 metres), boasting a beautiful, almost purple colour.  Overall, allow about two hours to get to Lake Le\u00ect from Tremorgio (just under three hours to Lake Varozzeira). Anyone wishing to try their hand at a more challenging hike, or stay in the area overnight, can take the three-and-a-half hour climb up to the Campo Tencia Hut (the first hut built in the Ticino Alps, it was opened in 1912) and the eponymous Pizzo Campo Tencia, which, standing at a height of 3701 metres, is the highest peak in the Ticino area (calculate around 3 hours from the hut) Inaugurated in the summer of 2016, the geo-tourism trail of Campolungo comprises two routes, a flatter one skirting Lake Tremorgio, and a more challenging one that leads to the Leit Hut.

The trail leads through well-preserved villages with traditional architecture and historical charm, accompanied by a wonderful view of the valley and the Mont Blanc massif. From the Val d'Entremont, a road leads over the Great St. Bernard pass into the Italian Aosta valley. The pass has been an important transit route for centuries. But the Valais valley is also home to a number of very well preserved historic villages and hamlets. This hike connects the most beautiful among them: Liddes, Chandonne, Commeire, La Rosi\u00e8re, Chamoille d'Orsi\u00e8res and La Douay. The oldest and most famous route through the valley is the Via Francigena, a historic pilgrimage route from Canterbury to Rome. This hike, on the other hand, takes you a little higher through sunny pastures, forests and sleepy mountain villages off the beaten track.  The starting point is Liddes with its 13th century church and an interesting little museum. Afterwards, you reach Chardonne, a peaceful hamlet at 1454 m altitude situated on a sunny terrace. All the villages along the route boast a rich architectural heritage in the form of traditional houses, chalets and barns. A prime example: the sustainable tourism project \"montagne alternative\" in Commeire, a so-called \"albergo diffuso\". Every fourth barn in the hamlet is part of the concept hotel. From the outside, you can\u2019t tell them apart from the rest of the barns and dwellings. The hamlet hides another, not immediately obvious surprise: an underground artillery fortification. Built in the early 1940s, it had room for almost 140 soldiers who would defend the valley. The complex can be visited and it is even possible to rent parts of it for events.  The next village, La Rosi\u00e8re, attracts pilgrims from all over the world: Maurice Tornay, a Catholic priest (1910-1949) grew up here. He was active in missions in China and Tibet and was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1993. His birthplace is open to the public.

Lake Lucerne is glistening far below as Gross Mythen towers in front of the hikers. The switchbacks leading to Gross Mythen are steep and require sure-footedness and an excellent condition. The exertion of your ascent will soon be forgotten when you arrive at the summit, however, with a breathtaking panoramic view of the Alps, Schwyz, the lakes in Central Switzerland and the expanse of the Mittelland region. An insider\u2019s tip: experiencing a sunrise or sunset on Gross Mythen is unforgettable. Also, a stop at the summit restaurant should not be missed before heading back because the Mythen nut and almond croissants here are legendary."

The pristine, lovely Schwarzsee, changing colour from turquoise to black, depending on the light, is both start and destination. The Schwarzsee, nestled in the foothills of the Fribourg Alps, looks dark. Legend has it that the water appears almost black since a giant washed his feet in it. The village of the same name extends along the western and northern shore of the Schwarzsee. The area located directly on the border between French- and German-speaking Switzerland is a popular destination, especially for those living in Fribourg and Bern. Surrounded by a majestic backdrop, including Kaiseregg, Spitzflue and the spotlight of this hike, the Schwyberg Mountains, the trail starts at the Hostellerie stop. From there it follows the lakeshore to Schwarzsee Bad on a level course. The ascent across meadows and through a scattering of trees turns at the edge of a forest. Shortly thereafter Fuchses Schwyberg is reached, an open peak with amazing views across the Schwarzsee Valley and the Kaiseregg, Spitzflue, Mol\u00e9son and La Berra mountains. A relatively flat section follows before the trail descends slightly toward Alp Hapferen Schwyberg. On the ridge in the direction of Gross Schwyberg the peak of Kaiseregg reappears and the views open up. Even Fribourg\u2019s fascinating Poya Bridge with its stay cables can be glimpsed in the distance. The highest point of the route offers a 360-degree panoramic view of 13 cantons. The descent on the hiking trail to the Gurli mountain restaurant starts near the Gross Schwyberg mountain hut. Follow the signs toward Holzena and Lichtena. The last part of the walk undulates along the shore of the Warme Sense River. The latter originates in the Schwarzsee and joins the Kalte Sense River near Zollhaus. From there on the river is called Sense and flows into the Saane River near Laupen. On the way to the source of the Warme Sense River and the destination of the walk, there are various opportunities to sit on a bench, rest your feet and enjoy the scenery. A number of activities are also available in the village, such as minigolf, swimming in the lake or summer sledding.",

Culture, history, impressive mountains, canyons, old irrigation channels, a charming winegrowing region and natural landscape \u2013 explore all this by crossing the Raspille river and the German-French language border. The hike begins in the old Valais village of Inden, which can be reached by bus or on foot from Leuk or Leukerbad. Inden was an important place as far back as the late Middle Ages. The Romans used the route to get to the Alps\u2019 richest thermal springs in Leukerbad. In addition, due to the mule trail across the Gemmi Pass, the Dala Valley was one of the most significant trade routes between the Bernese Oberland and the Valais for centuries.

An old lime kiln and turbines for a power plant are remnants from times gone by. From here the trail goes up moderately and continues directly along the vertical cliff. In 1779, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe described this trail as \u201cnot a dangerous, but a dreadful looking path\u201d.

The varied hike goes past the idyllic mountain tarn Lai da Juata and gives wonderful views of the mountain peaks in the Ortler range. \u00abSenda Val M\u00fcstair\u00bb is the name of the magnificent panorama trail on the sunny side of the valley. It starts at the summits of the Ofenpass (2,149 m) and follows a narrow footpath leading through the woods. Later one meets a road passing over a grassy plain, the Plaun da l'Aua. After about an hour you reach the Alp da Munt. The trail continues with beautiful views into the valley and over to the impressive peaks of Piz Daint and Piz Dora and the imposing snow-covered Ortler massif. The trail leads to the Juata plain with its idyllic mountain tarn Lai da Juata. At 2,260 m, this is the highest point of the hike. Minschuns - the skiing mountain for the M\u00fcnster valley - is passed on its south side. Soon the descent starts to Alp Champatsch, lying 200 metres lower. The original buildings of Alp Champatsch are now at the open-air museum at Ballenberg. The road now leads to L\u00fc, a tiny place where rare orchids and medicinal plants bloom."

After just 1.5 km you reach the timberline, and the Alpine panorama opens right out. The path leads across the rolling countryside with great views to the highest point of the tour, the \u00abHauptichopf\u00bb. After a further interesting journey along the \u00abScheidegg\u00bb with superb views, walk down to the \u00abOchsenalp\u00bb inn. After refreshments in the cosy alpine refuge, you reach the \u00abPr\u00e4tschalp\u00bb via the \u00abRot Tritt\u00bb section. Continue between the upper and lower Pr\u00e4tsch lakes, above the golf course, past the Maran dairy farm, to the final highlight of the round trip, the \u00abEichh\u00f6rnliweg\u00bb, and back to the railway station. The \u00abEichh\u00f6rnliweg\u00bb section is particularly popular with families. Along the way, you will come across some well-maintained fireplaces offering a welcoming respite."

The Four Headwaters Trail leads through richly contrasting landscapes in the cantons of Uri, Graubunden, Tessin and the Valais, to the sources of four rivers: the Rhine, Reuss, Ticino and Rhone. It crosses over six passes: the Maighels, Sella, Gotthard, Lucendro, Nufenen and Furka. The hike takes you through many wetlands with streams, pools, lakes and moors with typical vegetation. Longer sections lie above the tree line, where mainly dwarf shrubs are found. An extremely scenic high-level hike leads along the north slope of the Bedrettotal valley. Following a climb to the Nufenenpass the route leads 1100 m down into Obergoms. Along the way you catch sight of the Griesgletscher (glacier), Europe\u2019s highest-altitude wind turbine, a historic stone bridge dating from 1761 near Ladstafel, a gorge with hanging bridge and typical Walser houses.

A peaceful hike through alluvial forest and along the riverbank, ending in the middle of the fortifications of Bellinzona. Biasca on the old Gotthard train line is also the southern portal of the Gotthard base tunnel, the new trans-alpine train link NEAT. Slightly above neighbouring Bodio the trains pass through the 57 km tunnel, which went into full operation in December 2016. It takes just a few minutes to get from the Biasca railway station to the embankment of the Ticino. Hiking along the river is almost effortless. Near Lodrino you change from one side of the river to the other. A huge stone quarry is visible from the path. The quarried granite walls tower high above the Ticino.  Most of the time you won\u2019t even hear the traffic of the motorway or the train track on the hiking path. After a little more than four hours you will spot a rocky outcrop above Claro. This is the convent Santa Maria Assunta. Surrounded by chestnut trees, it has been an extraordinary place of silence, prayer and work since its foundation. Inside, the nuns are dedicating their lives in almost total seclusion to their faith. They sell pieces of embroidery, homemade honey and biscuits and also restore books, all of which benefits the livelihood of their community. After Claro you walk along an industrial area for a while. Excavators, conveyor belts, and tipper trucks transport stone in and out of a gravel plant. A gigantic crane with six arms follows later. This is a gravity power plant. The idea seems trivial and ingenious at the same time: When the energy need is low, concrete blocks are lifted up by means of renewable energy, and when the energy need is high the process is reversed to generate additional energy, similar to the system of hydropower with a dam and a pumping station. A standard tower of 60 meters can store 35 MWh of energy and supply 5 MW to the power grid. That\u2019s enough for 2,000 households. About an hour later you reach Bellinzona.

Hiking along the mountain trail, you see evidence of land use indicating the farmers\u2019 struggle for survival a century ago. Lavertezzo is world-famous \u2013 not least thanks to social media \u2013 for its Ponte dei Salti, also known as the Roman Bridge. It leads in a double arch over the Verzasca. However, the stone bridge was only constructed after the Roman period in the Middle Ages and rebuilt in 1960 after its partial destruction. After crossing the famous bridge, the route continues through a beautiful forest, always close to the Verzasca. Ticino's Verzasca Valley is unspoilt and partly rugged, boasting many waterfalls and steep slopes. In summer, the crystal-clear and emerald-green water invites you to swim. At Ponte di Corippo, you leave the riverbank and climb up to the village. Corippo was included in the Federal Inventory of Protected Heritage Sites. Narrow alleys connect the stone houses in the village centre, and the centre of what was once the smallest village in Switzerland remains preserved today. A visit is certainly worthwhile. The ascent to Mergoscia, with views of the valley, comes next. The path between the villages of Corippo and Mergoscia was already mentioned in 1741 as a mule track. It's an impressive stretch with many vantage points \u2013 including the reservoir with the famous dam wall. This is where James Bond (or his stunt double) in the film GoldenEye plunged 220 metres using a bungee rope. Daredevils can emulate the secret agent and book a jump on the elastic rope. After Mergoscia comes the hike's second and more strenuous part to Sotto Cresta. Once you've made it to the top, you will be rewarded with breathtaking lake views. After a little over four hours of hiking, you deserve a break here. Next up is the 500-metre descent to Tendrasca, continuing along a seemingly endless high-level trail above Tenero, Minusio, Muralto and Locarno.  You will already be very close to your destination at the Madonna del Sasso pilgrimage church. The church is one of Ticino's most important religious and historical sites.

The high-level hike over the Montagne du Droit links the windfarm on Montvel Crosin with the solar energy plant on Mont Soleil. Beautiful views to the Chasseral and into the French Jura region. The hike starts in Tramelan, which was closely associated with watchmaking up until the 1970s. Today, you can visit home workshops here. The windows of the temple church and the church of St. Michel also tempt you to explore. You leave Tramelan in a southerly direction. Passing the football pitch and following a straight path, you quickly reach the forest and the typical Jura landscape with its ancient trees and attractive flower-filled meadows. You see moss-covered stone walls as you proceed downwards on the northern hillside. Once on the wide, flat ridge of the hill, you look southwards across the Vallon de St. Imier with its magnificent view of the Chasseral. In contrast to the northern side, the southern hillside drops steeply and is densely forested. You pass a number of impressive windmills after Chalet-Neuf. They are part of Switzerland\u2019s largest wind farm, Mont Crosin, which produces electricity for about twenty thousand households. As the hike continues, you also go past the solar power plant on Mont Soleil. This was built in 1992 for research and demonstration purposes, and it was the largest photovoltaic solar power plant in Europe at the time. An adventure trail connects the energy plants. The path leads westwards across wide high Jura pastures and huge spruce trees. Various mountain farms and numerous drystone walls dividing the pastures blend superbly into the landscape. Depressions in the ground, known as dolines, offer shelter to animals such as foxes, wild boars, woodpeckers, lynxes and deer. They are formed through changes in the ground, which consists of rock that is easily penetrated by water \u2013 in this case limestone, and remarkable underground drainage systems with caves. Just before the village of Mont-Soleil, you come across another feature of this landscape: Champ Meusel, a circular hollow in the mountain with a diameter of about three hundred metres. A meteorite hit the mountain here. It is the largest surviving meteorite impact site in Switzerland. Since then, a wetland has developed within it.

In clear weather you can even see the Alps in the southeast. After a short while you get to the charming village of Wildensbuch. From here, it is worth taking a short detour to the Hohwacht hill, where a 37 m wooden observation tower was built. Make sure you go up to the platform to enjoy the terrific views from the Randen mountain range and the volcanic landscape of Hegau all the way to Lake Constance. Passing the old school of Wildensbuch with its clock tower, a short climb up the Sunnenberg follows before the hike descends gently to Rudolfingen, a fine example of a farming village at the foot of the Cholfirst.

Passing alpine pastures full of flowers, you then reach the plateau of the colourful high moor. An information board explains interesting facts about the nature reserve before you cross it. Because peat has never been extracted here, it is one of the most valuable moors of the Swiss aloes and can be experienced in its original form.  Countless little lakes and marsh ponds line the path together with high moor plants and loose clusters of small mountain pines. The centre of the moor is extensive and free of trees. The effort of the ascent is rewarded with an overwhelming view: the jagged peaks of the Garzen and the Wandelhorn tower up on the horizon along with the Engelh\u00f6rner on the other side. Equally unique: the Gyrensprung (1887 m. a.s.l.), whose shape is reminiscent of a ski jump to heaven. Once you have crossed Switzerland's best-preserved high moor, you reach the top of the Wandelalp.

Good hiking boots are certainly recommended for a sure-footed descent via Iseltwald and Falcheren to the impressive Reichenbach waterfall.

Horse breeding, Baroque church and cradle of T\u00eate de Moine AOP, the spicy cheese shaped into rosettes. The route continues between drystone walling and old water cisterns to Tramelan. Sornetan is about a hundred metres above the Sorne valley floor. Well-maintained farmhouses from the 18th and 19th centuries draw your attention here. The hike begins near the little 300-year-old church and proceeds westwards. After a short, flat section across a cattle pasture, the trail leads into the forest. The ascent now begins on the northern hillside of the Moron through a dense forest. You cross the steep slope on a surfaced path. At the top, you find yourself on wide Jura pastures with grazing horses. Beyond the village of Moron, the path runs downwards once more onto the plain. Just before Bellelay, you turn left onto the plains to the south. The town is famous for its impressive abbey, founded in 1136 and secularised in 1797. The property is now used as a psychiatric hospital. The monks of the abbey developed T\u00eate de Moine cheese in the 12th century, and its traditional production over a wood fire can be experienced in the on-site museum. You reach the wetland at Ri\u00e8re la Rouge Eau through the plain. Long footbridges made of wooden planks run across lush meadows and past rare flora. You pass the La Rouge Eau source on the left before arriving at the bus stop. Carts from Roman times have left impressive tracks in this area. Shortly after this, the trail leads between the hills of Moron and Montbautier, along an attractive tree-lined road and then to the right. A route with bends takes you up the eastern slope through the forest. There are steep cliffs either side of the trail, which culminates in an incredible view over the Vall\u00e9e de Tavannes. You come across blooming daffodils and ancient trees as well as attractive, slightly crumbling drystone walls on the way to the large farm on Montbautier. Straight trails lead past striking trees dotted here and there and along impressive tree-lined roads. The road takes you past the Haut de B\u00e9mont farm. It is now a leisurely hike over the crest of the hill to Le Chalet. Coniferous trees, a whole variety of flowers and the view of the Chasseral delight the senses. You reach the highest point of the hike at 1,169 metres and this is followed by the descent to Tramelan. Located on the southern hillside, Tramelan was closely associated with watchmaking up to the 1970s. The home workshops, the temple church windows and the church of St. Michel invite you to explore.",

In Vicques, you'll appreciate the modern construction of the church with its stained glass windows. A visit to the Observatory and the Astronomy House is another  enjoyable and cultural aspect to discover. Back to hiking, a climb through the meadows will take you to the forest hut Pre Godat.

It can be varied according to capability and time. The hike begins at Chli Sterne in Hoch-Ybrig after a gondola and chairlift ride. Then it continues on foot to Spirstock, with the Forstberg and Druesberg at your back, a view of Muota Valley and Stoos to the left, the endless expanse of Lake Sihl, Lake Zurich and Zurich Oberland to the right. From Spirstock the route continues past the Laucheren-Chappeli.The views from the chapel across to the mountains of Central Switzerland are amazing. Via Windegg and over Sternenegg the trail leads to the top of the Ibergeregg Pass with a guest house and a Lady chapel. The nature preserve located there is one of Europe\u2019s most bio-diverse. Ibergeregg has numerous low and high moors. These received the Landscape of the Year award in 2019 from the Swiss Foundation for Landscape Protection. The 7-peak hike continues gently up and down on a gravel road past the Zw\u00e4cken alpine farm. Locally made alpine products can be tasted here. Via M\u00fcsliegg the trail continues to the next peak (St\u00e4glerenegg), where the path very briefly enters a forest and exits near the Holzegg ski hut. The wide trail with views of the Alptal region passes the Brother Klaus chapel and reaches the peak of Holzegg. The mountain restaurant is located at the foot of the stunning Gross Mythen Mountain, the landmark of Schwyz. This is a great place to take a last look at the impressive steep rock wall, at Schwyz down below and nearby Stoos Mountain. Taking the gondola down to Brunni is definitely easier on the knees.

        "description": "The route features seven distinctive peaks in Central Switzerland, a ridgeway with impressive views of the Alps, lakes and valleys. It can be varied according to capability and time. The hike begins at Chli Sterne in Hoch-Ybrig after a gondola and chairlift ride. Then it continues on foot to Spirstock, with the Forstberg and Druesberg at your back, a view of Muota Valley and Stoos to the left, the endless expanse of Lake Sihl, Lake Zurich and Zurich Oberland to the right. From Spirstock the route continues past the Laucheren-Chappeli.The views from the chapel across to the mountains of Central Switzerland are amazing. Via Windegg and over Sternenegg the trail leads to the top of the Ibergeregg Pass with a guest house and a Lady chapel. The nature preserve located there is one of Europe\u2019s most bio-diverse. Ibergeregg has numerous low and high moors. These received the Landscape of the Year award in 2019 from the Swiss Foundation for Landscape Protection. The 7-peak hike continues gently up and down on a gravel road past the Zw\u00e4cken alpine farm. Locally made alpine products can be tasted here. Via M\u00fcsliegg the trail continues to the next peak (St\u00e4glerenegg), where the path very briefly enters a forest and exits near the Holzegg ski hut. The wide trail with views of the Alptal region passes the Brother Klaus chapel and reaches the peak of Holzegg. The mountain restaurant is located at the foot of the stunning Gross Mythen Mountain, the landmark of Schwyz. This is a great place to take a last look at the impressive steep rock wall, at Schwyz down below and nearby Stoos Mountain. Taking the gondola down to Brunni is definitely easier on the knees. The bus transports hikers back to the Einsiedeln railway station."

The high-altitude track lpasses through fantastic landscapes, majestic mountains and unique flora and fauna. For centuries this original track has been the most direct route between the cantons Uri and Glarus, following the wild and romantic valley of Sch\u00e4chental. Nowadays it starts at the Klausenpass on the sunny side of the valley and winds, both up and down, all the way to Eggbergen. This is high above B\u00fcrglen and Altdorf with magnificent views of the surrounding mountains. The hike also offers much with regards to flora and fauna. A lot of rainfall and impermeable grounds have given way to many moors. Those moors are the habitat of many rare and protected plants and animals. If you look carefully you might see many wild species, amongst them red deer, chamois, marmots, rabbits, foxes and badgers. Golden eagles can also quite often be seen in the valley of Sch\u00e4chental. From the pass of Klausen, the path takes you through beautiful alpine meadows to Untere Balm. After a short section on the main road you follow a walking track to the alp Heidmanegg. After Heidmanegg, the path will lead you on narrow tracks through ever changing, light forests at \u00c4bnet and through open and flowery alpine meadows. Above Ratzi the path then follows again a wider track to Biel. Then you walk through the hollow of Selez before reaching the little lake of Fleschsee. Fleschsee is an ideal family picnic spot with ready-built fire places.  Down to Gr\u00fcnen Boden through a light forest, you will then reach the cable car station of Eggbergen.

The hike starts in Les Prixes and first leads downhill through the forest. It then follows an undulating trail before the forest gets lighter and the route crosses the Manna River, situated near the authentic hamlet of Ossona. This is a showcase project for gentle and sustainable agritourism. It didn\u2019t always look as charming as it does now.

All this changed in 2005: The municipality of Saint-Martin decided to invest in an agritourism centre with financial support from the federal and the cantonal government. Disintegrated stables were renovated or rebuilt as inns. Today, Ossona has a cheese cellar, a solar system, and dairy cows and goats are grazing on the pastures. The restaurant serves local products. It also offers overnight accommodations and anybody interested is welcome to help with the work. After the peaceful hamlet, life gets exciting. Below Saint-Martin the route crosses a 133 m pedestrian suspension bridge spanning a steep 30 m drop. From the famous Passerelle de la Grande Combe the view of the pyramids of Euseigne is extraordinary. The bizarre rock formations are up to 15 m high and under nature conservation protection.

Here, you will be able to enjoy clear views from the S\u00e4ntis all the way to the Mont Blanc. Via Schofgraben you return to the starting point. The loop tour starts at the Kurhaus Balmberg. On the ascent to Nesselbodenr\u00f6ti, the R\u00f6tifluh provides a glimpse into the geology of the Solothurn Jura. Near Nesselbodenr\u00f6ti, at an altitude of 1223 metres, you can make a detour to the imposing Balmfluech\u00f6pfli viewpoint. The lakes of Biel, Neuch\u00e2tel and Murten seem close enough to touch from up here. The R\u00f6ti, the highest point between Weissenstein and Balmberg, is reached after a short climb in the opposite direction. At the triangulation point you may want to linger for a bit and enjoy the view over the Vosges, towards the Black Forest and to the huge steam cloud of the G\u00f6sgen nuclear power plant.  From R\u00f6ti, the path leads pleasantly downhill to the cable car top station and the Weissenstein hotel. The Weissenstein is considered the local mountain of the city of Solothurn. How about a glass of regional wine in the restaurant? If the weather is favourable, the view reaches from the S\u00e4ntis all the way to the Mont Blanc. And even into space: on the Weissenstein, there is a planetary theme path to Untergrenchenberg. Perhaps an idea for the next hike in the Solothurn region? Because the route described here branches off to the right at the planet Mars. Via Schofgraben and Balmberg pass, the hike ends back at the starting point.  Before returning, a visit to the Jura garden directly below the terrace of the Hotel Weissenstein is also worthwhile. There, some 200 plants typical of the Solothurn Jura and the neighbouring areas can be admired in a botanical garden. They are lovingly tended and labelled with signs between June and September. Adventure seekers will have fun at the rope park on the Balmberg: with its ten courses, it is one of the largest in Switzerland, including several tyroliennes up to 174 metres long.",

Along the Rhone, on winding forest paths and across fields with avenues of trees, it offers a sample of typical Geneva landscapes. If you go even further west from Geneva, you will be in the Champagne region with its fields and hills in just a few minutes. The route begins at the edge of this region, in Chancy on the border with France. The small town lies on the Geneva-Lyon trade route and has always been an important border and transit point. Chancy is agricultural, like all the villages in this fertile landscape. The first part of the hike takes you along the Rhone. It winds on a narrow path through a natural, unspoilt area to the famous border stone no. 1, which marks the westernmost point of the country.  Continuing along the French-Swiss border, past historical milestones, the route climbs through the Chancy forest on a listed path of national importance. Nearby, traces of Roman times have been found, such as the remains of a brickyard with a kiln. The route then leads down into the Vallon du Longet, where the river is crossed on a 45-metre-long wooden footbridge. The path dives into a canopy of leaves. After climbing back up the valley, the next river follows further on: the Laire, which has remained very natural. Near the river and the shooting range of Les Raclerets, there is a picnic area with a fireplace and southern flair: the ideal place for a break before continuing through the agricultural fields.  The rest of the route mostly consists of historic transport roads with a different atmosphere: leaving the forest, you cross through a hilly, picturesque landscape. The path is lined with avenues of oaks, typical of the canton of Geneva. You pass the village of Avusy with its castle, Champlong.

Before you lies the Sentiero Panoramico Val Bregaglia, a fantastic high-Alpine hike through one of Switzerland's most remote valleys. It soon becomes clear that you are hiking on historic paths. The first sign is the 200-year-old ramp on the Roman \u00abMal\u00f6gin\u00bb trading route. Shortly afterwards you cross the monumental Gothic walls of the S. Gaudenzio church ruins.

It leads through the ancient larch forest of Balavaux. On the descent, the next scenic highlight follows: the Japanese garden. The hike starts at the top station of the Tracouet cable car. From there you continue for a short distance in the direction of the Tracouet lake, and then the path descends in hairpin bends to the Balavaux hut. Here you are surrounded by gigantic larches, some of which seem to come straight out of a fairytale. They are among the oldest in Europe. There are more than 250 of them around the alp, some are 1000 years old. One of the oldest larches has a circumference of 14.6 metres and is possibly the largest in Europe. After passing under the Prarion-Plan du Fou cable car, the path is now narrower and you step over roots and pebbles in increasingly alpine surroundings. As you reach the meadow, the mountain peak Pointe des Champs Ferret (2742 m) is visible. A scree field and a torrent are crossed. The ascent continues to the left of the Pointe des Champs Ferret. This section is short and steep. About halfway up, between stones and rocks, you can admire the view of Balavaux, the alps, and Tracouet. At a good 2575 metres, the ascent is completed and a magnificent panorama of the Mont-Fort and Mont-Gel\u00e9 mountains opens up, as well as down to the Cleuson dam and the Japanese garden. The descent begins on a steep and uneven path along a small stream. Crossing an alp, you reach a wide dirt track and an old moraine. To the right: the Japanese garden situated on the \"roof\" of a glacial moraine. Small trees and streams, moss-covered stones, lush green meadows: unlike in Japan, where the gardens with precisely these elements were usually created artificially, here on the plateau they are found in a natural setting.

The hike starts at the Mont Blanc Express in Finhaut and passes through the village. At the upper end of it, near Les Thi\u00e9s, a signpost points to \"A travers Finhaut\".

Airolo is located in the Leventina district, which geographically comprises the valley of the Ticino river until Biasca, specifically the Val Bedretto and Valle Leventina valleys. The hike starts on the south side of the Gotthard Pass. Until Quinto you are mostly close to the motorway and able to gloat a bit when you look at the heavy traffic on the Gotthard route. Take the path to climb up to the rock outcrop with the remnants of Stalvedro castle, which probably dates back to the 13th century.  Back down again, follow the Ticino river to Piotta. The town is known primarily for its ice hockey club Ambri-Piotta. On the left side of the valley you will notice a funicular railway. With a maximum gradient of 87.8% it is one of the world\u2019s steepest funiculars. It leads to the Lago di Ritom reservoir in the area of the Lukmanier Pass. Cross the Ticino and continue following a forest path to Quinto where you cross the river again and turn into the forest. After the next, fairly short wooded section the lovely hike ends in Rodi.  Before the construction of the Gotthard railway, Rodi was highly dependent on the Piottino gorge. The first path crossing the gorge was built in the 14th century. Later, the Roman Road led from Rodi along the western side of the valley to Monte Piottino and finally down to Prato. The \u201cUrner Saumweg\u201d (mule track of Uri) was not built until the 16th century and led directly through the gorge. This is when the Dazio Grande customs house was built, because the gorge formed the border between Swiss and Milanese territory. For a long time Rodi consisted of only this one building for the transfer of goods. At the same time, it also served as a toll station and customs office. Today, the Dazio Grande is open to guests, offering a country-style restaurant, overnight accommodations and an exhibit about the gorge.",

This is shown by the \"Senda dils senns\" hike from Curaglia to the Val Plattas. At various points along this \"path of the senses\", information boards invite you to use your senses consciously and to pay attention to the sound of the wind, the smell of tree bark, the taste of fresh spring water or the feeling of soft moss under your feet.

The trails meander through the fascinating landscape of the Obergoms with flower-covered meadows and fragrant larch forests. High above the valley, the Gommer H\u00f6henweg (high-altitude trail) leads through the fascinating and authentic natural and cultural landscape of the Goms region. Fragrant larch trees and wide flower-covered meadows are bordering the path through the young Rhone Valley. Some of these flowers are otherwise only found in botany books. The massive Weisshorn pyramid (4505 m) towers on the horizon with other 3000 and 4000 m peaks of the Valais forming the backdrop. Small villages and sleepy hamlets with their typical sun-darkened huts are visible down in the valley. The trail starts in Oberwald, the first village in the Goms region at the foot of Furka and Grimsel. This used to be an important Alpine trading centre. From the village the path rises through a meadow up to the edge of the forest. It crosses the track of the cog railway and enters the first larch forest. High above the valley it traverses the bridges over several mountain streams along the slope. After the Oberbach bridge it climbs a few meters up to the information board describing the panorama. Here at 1712 m is the highest point of the Gommer high-altitude trail. The chance to observe wildlife is particularly good in the forests protecting the villages in the valley against avalanches, falling rocks and landslides. Finally, a short downhill section to reach M\u00fcnster, the main town of the Goms region. With its intricate, typical Goms houses the village has gained national importance. The old larch-wood huts were built on stakes to protect them from gnawing rodents. Of course, the other villages in the Obergoms region are also worth a visit. It takes less than 30 minutes to reach the high-altitude trail from any of them. Interesting hiking options are available as the Matterhorn Gotthard railway stops at every village.

The forest in the Verzasca Valley was used far into the 20th century for coal and timber production. When trees were cut, the slopes lost their hold. The forest where the path now leads had to be reforested to protect the road. Back down in the valley, the route continues to the Motta hamlet and shortly thereafter to a bridge crossing the Verzasca river. The path now turns and follows the right side of the river. Mostly in the forest it continues, sometimes over a flight of steps, to Lavertezzo. The crystal-clear, emerald torrent flows through the valley, roaring and foaming at times, quiet and serene at others. The double-arched Ponte dei Salti shortly before the destination is a popular photo spot. The natural bathtubs created by erosion are often used for swimming \u2013 a perfect end before the return to the village."

Lovely moorland landscapes on the way through the Schlierental and across the Schlierengrat in the region of the Entlebuch biosphere reserve. The world\u2019s steepest cogwheel railway with a maximum gradient of 48% travels from Alpnachstad to the summit of Mt. Pilatus. Lucerne\u2019s very own mountain was once known as a source of treacherous storms and floods as well as the home of dragons and other monsters. It is said that the mountain took its name from Pontius Pilate, the governor of a Roman province at the time of Jesus Christ. Legend has it that he was buried in the lake at the mountain top. The route starts at Pilatus Kulm. It heads down to the valley and offers a magnificent view across the lakes of Central Switzerland, the city of Lucerne and countless mountain peaks. Within about a two-hour walk, it descends approximately 1000 meters in altitude, first on a steep path followed by a gravel road and surrounded by craggy mountain cliffs and blossoming meadows.  After L\u00fctholdsmatt the route goes gently uphill again. A broad gravel road leads to W\u00e4ngen where it briefly changes to a path. Taking a look behind you now and then, toward the start of today\u2019s tour and to Stanserhorn Mountain on the other side, is well worth it. After hiking more than four hours, an attractive two-hour section starts at Chr\u00fczliegg and continues to Schlierengrat, going gently up and down along the white-red-white trail markers. Through blueberry bushes, past gnarled pines and spruce, some of which have died off, you reach B\u00e4rnerstig, an old crossing to the Entlebuch region.   Next you pass through a fantastic moorland area leading to Schwendi Kaltbad, once a recognized health resort with a sanatorium. It was known for the healing power of its mud and sulphur baths. In the summer, Alpine church services and weddings are held in the small chapel. It doesn\u2019t take long to get to Langis from here, the end of this lovely, but sometimes strenuous hike. Langis is located above Lake Sarnen. It is popular with cross-country skiers as well as winter and snowshoe hikers. In the summer, it is an insider tip among nature enthusiasts because of the beautiful protected moor landscape with birches, pine trees and mountain meadows.",

Since the Gotthard Railway opening in 1882, it has been a landmark on the train ride south, during which you get to see the little Baroque church from three different angles. The stone and wood-built houses, along with the splendid fountain dominating the village square, are also a sight to behold. After two short sections along the motorway, the route leaves the road for good and continues slightly above the Reuss river. At Fusterblacken, you are directly above the motorway. A little further on, the path turns into a gravel road. The route continues along the railway line to G\u00f6schenen. Most people know G\u00f6schenen, located at the top of the Urner Reusstal valley, only from passing through it. The village was bustling between 1872 and 1882 and again almost a hundred years later, from 1970 to 1980. At the time, the world's longest railway tunnel and later the longest road tunnel were built. For this purpose, thousands of guest workers come to the village. Stretching to the west of G\u00f6schenen, away from the flow of traffic, lies the G\u00f6scheneralptal valley, a breathtakingly beautiful recreational area boasting reservoirs, moors, ponds and the 3,630-metre-high Dammastock.  The route now leads through the Sch\u00f6llenenschlucht (gorge) and, shortly after, across the beautiful, three-arch H\u00e4derlisbr\u00fccke (stone bridge). Your hike continues directly above the road, with the Reuss roaring ever more wildly through the valley.

Around the year 1200, the people of Ursern \u2013 who knows, maybe even with help from the devil \u2013 achieved the unique feat of building a bridge across the gorge, which was previously considered impassable.

Information panels illustrate the history of the valley from Roman times to the present day. Along the way, you can visit the Vallorbe Iron and Railway Museum, the Le Day viaduct and the Saint-Maurice chapel. The theme trail between Vallorbe, Ballaigues and the French village of Jougne explores the geography, history and present time of the cross-border industrial valley of La Jougnena. It follows an inoperative railway line and a former pilgrimage route. Information panels along the way explain the history of the trade and transport routes since Roman times as well as the development of crafts and iron smelting. Further information documents are available from the tourism office in Vallorbe. Surrounded by lush greenery, Vallorbe nestles on the banks of the Orbe river. The hike starts at the train station which is surprisingly large for a village with less than 4000 inhabitants. This is due to its historical importance: Vallorbe is a railway junction and an important border station. In 1915, the Mont d'Or tunnel was opened here on the Paris-Dijon-Vallorbe-Lausanne-Simplon-Milan line. The trains cross the Orbe river on the impressive Le Day railway viaduct which you pass along the hiking trail. Some 450 metres downstream, the Orbe is dammed by the Barrage du Day. Crossing the dam wall, the trail then continues to Ballaigues.     A bit outside in the forest near Chez Barrat, you will discover a historical track (Roman road). In the middle of the 19th century, salt was transported from the French salt works to Bern and western Switzerland. After a short while you enter France on foot. The trail follows the river Jougnena which rises at the south-western end of the Aiguilles de Baulmes, flows into France and then back into Switzerland into the Orbe. Before arriving in Jougne, where you turn around, you pass the Saint-Maurice chapel. It is located on a former pilgrimage route between the abbey of Saint-Maurice in Valais and Burgundy. From Jougne, you follow a railway line that once connected Vallorbe at the foot of Mont d'Or and Dent de Vaulion with Pontarlier. Opened in 1875, it was damaged during the Second World War and gradually closed down. If you want to delve further into the industrial history of the region, you can visit the iron and railway museum back in Vallorbe.",

This is due to its historical importance: Vallorbe is a railway junction and an important border station. In 1915, the Mont d'Or tunnel was opened here on the Paris-Dijon-Vallorbe-Lausanne-Simplon-Milan line. The trains cross the Orbe river on the impressive Le Day railway viaduct which you pass along the hiking trail. Some 450 metres downstream, the Orbe is dammed by the Barrage du Day. Crossing the dam wall, the trail then continues to Ballaigues.     A bit outside in the forest near Chez Barrat, you will discover a historical track (Roman road). In the middle of the 19th century, salt was transported from the French salt works to Bern and western Switzerland. After a short while you enter France on foot. The trail follows the river Jougnena which rises at the south-western end of the Aiguilles de Baulmes, flows into France and then back into Switzerland into the Orbe. Before arriving in Jougne, where you turn around, you pass the Saint-Maurice chapel. It is located on a former pilgrimage route between the abbey of Saint-Maurice in Valais and Burgundy. From Jougne, you follow a railway line that once connected Vallorbe at the foot of Mont d'Or and Dent de Vaulion with Pontarlier. Opened in 1875, it was damaged during the Second World War and gradually closed down. If you want to delve further into the industrial history of the region, you can visit the iron and railway museum back in Vallorbe."

Panoramic views of Valais Alps and Diableret glacier world. This tour's starting point is Gsteig near Gstaad in the upper Saane Valley. The stream that flows through the village is still the R\u00fcschbach, which joins the Saane immediately afterwards. At the beginning of the hike, you pass the old Hotel and Restaurant B\u00e4ren, an 18th-century house with a beautifully decorated fa\u00e7ade. You reach the Saane on a short, asphalted stretch in about 20 minutes and continue to the valley station of the Sanetsch cable car, which used to provide access to the power station. It takes you approximately 850 metres up to the Sanetsch reservoir, shortening the hike by about two and a half hours. Without the cable car, the old mule track quickly steepens and winds through the forest for the first 400 vertical metres. You cross the Saane several times, but unfortunately, you can only see very little of the Sanetsch Falls. Continuing along the path, you soon pass the tree line, and the view of the mountain peaks to the south becomes spectacular. Along the way, you encounter magnificently flowering plants, depending on the season. The mule track connected the Saanenland and the Rhone Valley as early as the Middle Ages. After crossing the cantonal border, the trail continues a few more metres uphill to the restaurant, where you can enjoy a drink and the views of the bright blue Sanetsch reservoir. The reservoir, built in 1963, can be circumnavigated on the approximately 1.3-kilometre-long route. After the break, follow a varied path along the left bank of the reservoir. Any slightly exposed parts are secured with chain railings. Continuing along the River Saane, \"La Sarine\" in French, you reach the Sanetsch Pass or Col de S\u00e9nin a little later. The Sanetschhorn catches the eye on the right. The mountain peak is the source of the 126-kilometre-long Saane. As you cross the pass, the Alpine panorama's scenery changes, and your gaze wanders to the high alpine peaks of Valais. The last part of the trail to the H\u00f4tel Restaurant du Sanetsch gives a foretaste of the next stage. On the right, you can already see the furrowed limestone, the so-called karst fields.",

Biel/Bienne is not only a city where bilingualism is alive and well but also a watchmaking and industrial town. For instance, the Swatch watch company has its headquarters in Biel/Bienne with one of the world's largest timber structures, resembling a gigantic \"Tatzelwurm\". The second stage of the Seeland-Solothurn Trail starts at Biel/Bienne railway station and immediately passes Nidau Castle. The castle was a massive water fortress until late in the 19th century. After the Jura water correction, the water level dropped by around two metres. You cross the Nidau-B\u00fcren canal shortly after the castle at the Port ship lock. The hike now leads along the Aare, which is actually not the Aare itself but bears witness to the Jura water correction and is thus an entirely man-made part of the river, to B\u00fcren an der Aare. In those days, the Aare flowed in broad meanders from Aarberg towards Solothurn. The river's path at the time led to devastating floods, as the water could spread almost unhindered over the flat terrain of the Seeland. The Jura water correction took place between 1868 and 1891. The Aare was diverted into Lake Biel through the construction of the Aare-Hagneck Canal, the Broye and Zihl were straightened and deepened, and the Nidau-B\u00fcren Canal was dug. After about two hours along the canal, the trail crosses the bridge between Orpund and Scheuren. A few minutes later, you reach two hamlets in Meienried, where you cross the Alte Aare, once a mighty river, now just a stream at this point.

        "text": "Matterhorn Ascent On the day before the climb, one takes the cable car from Zermatt (1,620 m) to Schwarzsee (2,583 m). From there, one follows the hiking trail to the H\u00f6rnli Hut\u00a0Matterhorn (3,260 m). The climb to the hut takes about two hours. One should not arrive too early, since the hut is only ready for occupancy after 3 pm. After dinner, a discussion of the schedule plan for the next day takes place and the equipment is controlled. And then it is time to go to sleep. Because the hut warden wakes climbers at 4 am, and after breakfast, it is time to put on the climbing harness, hiking boots and helmet.  Climbers with mountain guides form a column and set off by foot first. In the dark, it is difficult to find the correct path; here, a mountain guide and a headlamp are necessary. It is very important to walk carefully on the loose gravel, because every misstep could start a rockslide for the following climbers.  The enjoyment of climbing on the H\u00f6rnligrat is a real pleasure for the mountain guides if one is fit enough to do so. The experience at the summit is unforgettable. Once one is at the top, there is a breath-taking panorama in every direction: Mont Blanc, the Grande Paradiso of the Bernese Alps and below the Liongrat towards Italy, the steep north face and the Mattertal. The climbers, who made the first ascent already used this route to conquer the Matterhorn in 1865. The H\u00f6rnligrat is primarily gneiss, which means that the danger of sliding and falling rocks is great. For this reason, it is important to engage a mountain guide for the climb. If one is just one metre off the route, one is already subject to falling rocks or can cause that.

        "description": "On the day before the climb, one takes the cable car from Zermatt (1,620 m) to Schwarzsee (2,583 m). From there, one follows the hiking trail to the H\u00f6rnli Hut\u00a0Matterhorn (3,260 m). The climb to the hut takes about two hours. One should not arrive too early, since the hut is only ready for occupancy after 3 pm. After dinner, a discussion of the schedule plan for the next day takes place and the equipment is controlled. And then it is time to go to sleep. Because the hut warden wakes climbers at 4 am, and after breakfast, it is time to put on the climbing harness, hiking boots and helmet.  Climbers with mountain guides form a column and set off by foot first. In the dark, it is difficult to find the correct path; here, a mountain guide and a headlamp are necessary. It is very important to walk carefully on the loose gravel, because every misstep could start a rockslide for the following climbers.  The enjoyment of climbing on the H\u00f6rnligrat is a real pleasure for the mountain guides if one is fit enough to do so. The experience at the summit is unforgettable. Once one is at the top, there is a breath-taking panorama in every direction: Mont Blanc, the Grande Paradiso of the Bernese Alps and below the Liongrat towards Italy, the steep north face and the Mattertal. The climbers, who made the first ascent already used this route to conquer the Matterhorn in 1865. The H\u00f6rnligrat is primarily gneiss, which means that the danger of sliding and falling rocks is great. For this reason, it is important to engage a mountain guide for the climb. If one is just one metre off the route, one is already subject to falling rocks or can cause that. There are a few famous places that one passes on the way to the top: during the ascent past the protecting Madonna, at Grampiturm, yellow stripe, faules Eck (lazy corner), bite, lower and upper Moseley plate, Solvay Hut, shoulder, fixed rope, roof, Swiss summit (4,478 m), Italian summit (4,477 m) with metal peak cross.

The trail then leads along the foot of the Gonzen through woodlands and meadows, with views over the Rhine Valley. Via Alpina is a 390 km long-distance hiking trail crossing 14 Alpine passes. It starts just above the village of Gaflei, once the first health resort in the Principality of Liechtenstein. The sanatorium is long gone, but the view of the mountains of Eastern Switzerland from the sunny plateau is as dazzling as ever. Passing gnarled evergreens, meadows and bright green ferns and grass, the hiking trail melts into a dense forest and leads downward through some zigzags. At the ruins of Schalun castle, built in the late 12th century, you\u2019re at 860 m and half of the downhill elevation change is already behind you.  Continue further down the valley, on a wide gravel road now, to reach the castle of Vaduz in about an hour. Liechtenstein\u2019s landmark is perched on a rock terrace high above the capital. The roots of the castle are probably dated somewhere in the 12th century. It has served as the residence for Liechtenstein\u2019s first family since 1938. Through the lovely town and past the Rheinpark stadium you reach the border crossing on the Rhine. The old Rhine bridge (Alte Rheinbr\u00fccke) is 135 m long and connects Vaduz with the village of Sevelen in the Canton St. Gallen. It is the last surviving bridge across the Alpine Rhine. Out of 15 wooden bridges in the St.Gallen Rhine Valley, it is the only one that has withstood all floods and fires. On the next section to Sevelen the route follows the main road. Past the ruins of Procha castle and through the villages of Fontnas and Azmoos it takes roughly two more hours to get to Tr\u00fcbbach.  Beautiful forest roads and a path take you to the old iron ore mine of Gonzen. The mining resulted in a labyrinth of tunnels and galleries of just under 90 km. In the 15th century the ore was used by the old confederates to make the dreaded cut and thrust weapons. Some of the traffic noise can be heard even on the forest paths. Continue through well-tended residential neighbourhoods with views across the Rhine Valley and the Sargans region until you get to the Sargans castle a short while later. The structure was purchased by the community of Sargans in the late 19th century to save it from crumbling.

The fifth route in the heart of the National Park takes you from the Ofen Pass across Muottas Champl\u00f6nch down to the deep Sp\u00f6lschlucht gorge and back up to Fuorcla Murter. The views here range far across valleys full of rocks and boulders, steep mountain slopes and rocky peaks.

The \u201cDreiland-Wanderweg\u201d (Three-Country Hiking Trail) is a cross-border route that connects Germany, France and Switzerland. This stage begins at the Schiffl\u00e4nde, the oldest port facility in Basel, which is now a landing stage for excursion boats and ships. The impressive Middle Bridge on the Rhine near the Schiffl\u00e4nde was built in 1905, replacing the former bridge from 1226. The first bridge was commissioned by Bishop Heinrich von Thun. In order to protect the bridge and ensure safe access to the episcopal lands in Breisgau, he had the then fortified Kleinbasel built on the right side of the river. From the 14th century, the bridge was part of an important north-south trade connection.  You reach Marktplatz not long after starting.

After passing the small hill of St. Margarethen, you leave the surfaced road and follow a gravel path that crosses fields until you reach the Bruderholz Cantonal Hospital.

It is surrounded by an extremely rich mosaic of different habitats: remains of mountain pine upland moors, spruce forest groves, peat bogs, fens and the winding river Biber with its alluvial pastureland. Local service providers join Pro Natura in advocating the preservation of this upland moor.   The moorland path is also highly recommended: here, visitors can hike on paths with gravel and wooden-slat surfaces or well-beaten tracks. The route crosses forests with six-foot ferns and open areas with rare plants such as orchids, cotton grasses and willow gentian."

Due to its high altitude, it is best hiked either in summer or early fall. The walk is not difficult but it does require a little training and the right equipment. The route starts from the Hospice situated at the top of the St. Gotthard Pass (2091 metres), which  can be reached by car (parking is available) of by PostBus. Following the trail (identified with white/red markings) indicating Orsino-Realp, you head towards the Lucendro Dam. The lake of the same name is particularly striking on account of its intense and somewhat unusual light green colour. The next expanse of water on the trail is Lake Orsino. Standing at an altitude of 2286 metres its banks are part gravel and part grass, while its waters are of such a deep blue color that they almost seem to be an open eye looking upwards towards the sky. Just a little further you will see a farmhouse.  As you climb upwards you can continue to admire this beautiful small lake while other two are already getting closer: those of the Orsirora. The first is of a deep green color, while the second is blue. Who knows if their name is in some way associated with the past presence of bears in the region? On the way, you will also encounter other two small lakes called Valletta (2468 and 2432 m) and, further on, several more, boasting iridescent blue or emerald waters, that are bizarrely shaped, and which also reflect the sky and the mountains. Set amidst moss and rocks, these sparkling pools of water, stirred by light breezes that ripple their surface, will most definitely enchant visitors. They are all beautiful, whether you decide to stop and admire them from their banks, immersed in silence, or whether you decide to view them from above.  Along the route you will be surrounded by Alpine flora and fauna and who knows, you might even happen to chance upon a few timid marmots. The trail takes around 5 hours without stops.

A 30-metre-high vantage tower giving views over the Alpine foothills to the high Alps. Moutier is surrounded by deep valleys and gorges and wild nature. You can admire excellent glass works of art in the Notre-Dame de la Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t\u00e9 church and the Saint Germain collegiate church. The local precision engineering companies also have a national reputation. The first machine tools were built here and the industry still shapes Moutier today. The hike begins in the valley basin of the Birs. Part of the river flows directly along by the walls of the houses and forms a narrow alley through Moutier. You reach the end of the residential area across the Birs and briefly following the La Chali\u00e8re river. You then ascend on an attractive track at the eastern tip of the Moron. The ridge extends over a length of around 12 kilometres, going from east to west, and averages a width of 2 to 3 kilometres. You reach the broad ridge area through beech and fir forests. Drystone walls stretch in a dead straight line across the hills, and several mountain farms are to be found among the wide-ranging Jura pastures. By the time you reach the hamlet of Pr\u00e9s du Haut de la Charri\u00e8re, half the climb is done. A gravel road now takes you down a gentler incline to Moron Tower. The Ticino architect Mario Botta designed the 30-metre-high building. It was completed in 2004 with the help of around 700 apprentices. The construction was intended to promote the work of bricklayers and stonemasons. There is a spiral staircase with about 190 steps in the impressive tower, with each weighing 400 kg. You cover the final metres to the viewing platform on metal steps inside the tower. Once at the top, you enjoy a spectacular panorama of the Alps from S\u00e4ntis to Mont Blanc, and in the north from the Vosges to the Black Forest. The tower had to be closed temporarily (from summer 2023) when several of the steps broke off in 2022. You reach the highest point of the hike at 1,319 metres. Now a light gravel road running straight through the Jura pastures leads downhill again. Passing molehills, attractive trees and horse pastures, you reach the Pr\u00e8s de la Montagne farm. The trail turns here and heads north to Sornetan. Just 4 kilometres to the west is the former Abbey of Bellelay, where T\u00eate de Moine cheese was developed in the 12th century.

If you still feel like it, you can follow the valley waters of the Fildrich which joins the Chirel at Horboden. You continue between forest and river until the route ends back in the village of Oey in the foremost part of the Diemtigtal valley."

Highlights: the Bernina pass with its lakes, the Diavolezza, the flowery Val Roseg, the culturally significant Engadine village of Sils together with views of the Bianco mountain ridge or the Upper Engadine lakes. An unparalleled scenery: this long-distance hike offers impressive views of all the glaciers in the Bernina massif. At 4049 metres, Piz Bernina is the only four-thousand-metre peak in the eastern alps and also the highest mountain in Graub\u00fcnden. On this tour it is circled as far as Maloja. As you start out on the southern side of the alps, you will experience a Mediterranean atmosphere against an alpine backdrop. From Poschiavo with its townscape of national importance, the first stage of the UNESCO world heritage route follows the Rhaetian railway. On the way to the Bernina pass at 2328 metres, you will see the Cavaglia glacier garden with its glacier mills and Alp Gr\u00fcm, offering a first view of the eastern side of the Bernina massif. The pass itself not only represents the main European water divide between the Black Sea and the Adriatic, but also the border between the Rhaeto-Romanic and Italian language zones.   At the Bernina hospice, a breather on the even, wide path along Lago Bianco helps to loosen the muscles. This is necessary, because the second stage climbs all the way up to the Diavolezza top station with spectacular views of Piz Pal\u00fc and Piz Bernina with the legendary Bianco ridge. You can take the mountain railway down to the valley or the trail past the Lej da Diavolezza. Once down, a steep ascent begins on the other side of the Val Bernina towards Fuorcla Pischa at 2835 metres. A jewel right at the start of the third stage: the Val da Fain, known for its magnificent alpine flora and the multitude of marmots. The area around Piz Albris is home to one of the largest ibex colonies in the alps. You descend through the Val Languard to Pontresina, the destination of this stage, either on foot or from Alp Languard by chairlift. After leaving the mountain resort, the trail takes you into the lovely Val Roseg. It branches off in front of the Hotel Restaurant Roseg Gletscher, and you find yourself surrounded by stone pines, larches and alpine flowers with a great view of the Sella and Roseg glaciers. Once you reach Fuorcla Surlej, you can see the lake Lej da Vadret and the Bianco ridge of Piz Bernina to your left. After Fuorcla Surlej, the wide path ends at the middle station Murt\u00e8l of the Corvatsch cable car. The last section is a downhill traverse along the mountain flank to Alp Pras\u00fcra. In the valley between the lakes of Silvaplana and Sils, you arrive at the culturally significant village of Sils with the well-known district of Sils Maria. Past the church of Sils Baselgia and now on the Via Engiadina, the route leads through Grevasalvas on the left side of the valley, where a Heidi film was shot in the 1970s.

This glacier adventure offers unimpeded views and is quite intoxicating \u2013 even without a glass of Valais wine. Stone steps take you up to an unforgettable experience on Europe\u2019s largest ice flow.    The route crosses the Grosses Gufer Glacier and continues down to Rote Chumma. On hot summer days the fresh glacier breeze is especially pleasant. Carved into the rock, the wide mountain trail finally winds its way to M\u00e4rjelensee lake. In previous times, a mighty wall of ice from the Aletsch Glacier impounded the lake and icebergs the size of houses floated on the water. Today, the polar landscape has yielded to an idyllic postcard setting, showing its best side in spring with its picturesque cotton grass meadows.    There is no reason whatsoever to resist the apple tart that is served straight from the wood-fired oven in Restaurant Gletscherstube. Unless perhaps those watching their waistlines choose to give the trail around the Talligrat with its fabulous views of the Fiescher Glacier a miss in order to take the shortcut and save an hour. Through an illuminated tunnel, you reach the other side of Talligrat, where a wide hiking trail leads down to Fiescheralp.

Here, there is a special treat in store for the younger guests - a petting zoo with goats, rabbits and other animals as well as a playground. And from here, the high-altitude trail starts that leads to the legendary Lake Lauenen. As you follow the ridge, you enjoy breathtaking panoramic views over the Saanenland and the imposing peaks of the Oldenhorn Group. On the way to the Chrinetritt you will pass one of the two giant fondue caquelons found at the destination of Gstaad (approx. 40 minutes from Wispile mountain station). If you have a fondue rucksack with you, you can enjoy a delicious fondue right here and now, surrounded by mountain scenery. The backpacks with all the necessary ingredients are available at all Alpine dairies in the Saanenland if reserved in advance. Once at the Chrinetritt, the trail takes you along the ridge and up the Chrine Pass. Once there, you scale about 100 altitude metres on the way towards Lake Lauenen. Now going downhill again, you reach the pristine nature reserve at Lake Lauenen. This gained nationwide fame through the song about it by the band known as \u00abSpan\u00bb.

Those who wish to avoid the descent of about 400 altitude meters continue to the Grimmialp mountain station and take the convenient chairlift down to the valley."

The Swiss Museum of Games in the castle at Tour-de-Peilz and famous Schloss Chillon are worth a visit before you reach the Chablais wine region. Am Ostrand des Rhonetals, inmitten der Weinberge des Chablais, beginnt die Wanderung von Aigle nach St. Maurice. Das Quartier du Bourg mit seinen schmalen G\u00e4sschen und H\u00e4usern, die eng beieinander stehen und teils durch Lauben verbunden sind, bildet den Mittelpunkt des St\u00e4dtchens. Bedeutendster Bau von Aigle ist das Schloss, an dem man kurz nach dem Start beim Bahnhof vorbeiwandert. Es wurde im 12. Jhdt. zum Schutz von Aigle erbaut und erm\u00f6glichte die Kontrolle des Zugangs ins Rhonetal und Pays d\u2019Enhaut.  Nach einem kurzen Waldst\u00fcck werden die n\u00e4chsten Weinberge rund um Ollon nach rund eineinhalb Stunden erreicht. Anschliessend wandert man wieder etwas hinauf, um schon bald wieder nach Antagnes abzusteigen. Die Aussicht \u00fcber das Rhonetal und die umliegenden Berge ist herrlich. Beim Fluss La Gryonne ist die H\u00e4lfte der Wanderung geschafft und beinahe schon alle H\u00f6henmeter.  Dem Fluss folgt man bis kurz vor dessen M\u00fcndung in die Rhone, welche man etwas sp\u00e4ter \u00fcberquert, um nach Massongex zu gelangen. Das Dorf war vor langer Zeit die Hauptstadt des keltischen Wallis. Hier folgt die letzte Wanderstunde zum Ziel der Etappe in St. Maurice. Pilger, die den gesamten Weg von Canterbury nach Rom wandern, befinden sich jetzt genau in der Mitte. Kurz vor St. Maurice passiert man die Feengrotte. Das Wasser hat hier den Felsen \u00fcber Jahrtausende ausgesp\u00fclt und die Grotte mit dem kleinen unterirdischen See und einem Wasserfall entstehen lassen. C\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 est de la vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne, au c\u0153ur du vignoble du Chablais, que commence la randonn\u00e9e d\u2019Aigle \u00e0 St-Maurice. Le quartier du Bourg avec ses ruelles \u00e9troites et ses maisons coll\u00e9es les unes aux autres, dont certaines sont reli\u00e9es par des arcades, constitue le point central de la petite ville. L\u2019\u00e9difice le plus important d\u2019Aigle est le ch\u00e2teau que l\u2019on longe peu apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9part de la gare. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit au 12e si\u00e8cle pour prot\u00e9ger Aigle et permettre le contr\u00f4le de l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne et au Pays d\u2019Enhaut. Apr\u00e8s un court passage par la for\u00eat, on atteint les prochains vignobles autour d\u2019Ollon apr\u00e8s environ une heure et demie de marche. Ensuite, on remonte un peu pour redescendre peu apr\u00e8s vers Antagnes. La vue sur la vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne et les montagnes environnantes est magnifique. Au niveau de la rivi\u00e8re la Gryonne, vous avez fait la moiti\u00e9 du chemin et franchi presque tous les m\u00e8tres de d\u00e9nivel\u00e9.  On suit la rivi\u00e8re jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son embouchure dans le Rh\u00f4ne, que vous traversez un peu plus tard pour arriver \u00e0 Massongex. Ce village \u00e9tait il y a fort longtemps la capitale du Valais celtique. Vous vous attaquez d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re heure de marche avant d\u2019arriver \u00e0 St-Maurice, terme de l\u2019\u00e9tape. Les p\u00e8lerins qui effectuent l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019itin\u00e9raire de Canterbury \u00e0 Rome se trouvent ici exactement au milieu du parcours. Peu avant St-Maurice, on passe devant la Grotte aux f\u00e9es. Au cours des mill\u00e9naires, l\u2019eau a creus\u00e9 la roche pour donner naissance \u00e0 cette grotte avec son petit lac souterrain et sa cascade.  Sulla sponda orientale della valle del Rodano, tra i vigneti dello Chablais, inizia l'escursione da Aigle a Saint-Maurice. Il Quartier du Bourg, con i suoi vicoli stretti e le case molto ravvicinate tra loro e in parte collegate da portici, costituisce il cuore della cittadina. L'edificio pi\u00f9 importante di Aigle \u00e8 il castello, a cui si giunge poco dopo la partenza dalla stazione ferroviaria. Fu costruito nel XII secolo per proteggere Aigle e controllare l'accesso alla valle del Rodano e al Pays d'Enhaut.  Dopo un breve tratto nel bosco, circa un'ora e mezza pi\u00f9 tardi, si raggiungono i vigneti intorno a Ollon. In seguito, si sale ancora un po' per scendere presto ad Antagnes. La vista sulla valle del Rodano e sulle montagne circostanti \u00e8 magnifica. Una volta raggiunto il fiume La Gryonne, si \u00e8 a met\u00e0 dell'escursione e si sono gi\u00e0 superati tutti i metri di dislivello.  Si segue il fiume fino a poco prima della sua confluenza nel Rodano, che viene attraversato poco dopo per raggiungere Massongex. Un tempo questo villaggio era la capitale del Vallese celtico. Qui inizia l'ultima ora di cammino verso la meta della tappa, Saint-Maurice. I pellegrini che percorrono l'intero cammino da Canterbury a Roma si trovano ora esattamente a met\u00e0 strada. Poco prima di Saint-Maurice, si passa davanti alla Grotta delle Fate. Qui l'acqua ha levigato la roccia nel corso di migliaia di anni e ha creato una grotta con un piccolo lago sotterraneo e una cascata. The hike from Aigle to St. Maurice begins on the eastern edge of the Rhone Valley, in the middle of the Chablais vineyards. The district of Bourg forms the heart of the little town. It is characterised by narrow streets and houses that stand close together and are partly connected by archways. The most important building in Aigle is the castle, which you pass shortly after the start of the stage at the train station. It was built in the 12th century to protect Aigle, and it enabled access to the Rhone Valley and Pays d'Enhaut to be controlled. After a short stretch of forest, you reach the next vineyards around Ollon in about one and a half hours. The hike is uphill for a while, then proceeds downwards again to Antagnes. There is an incredible view across the Rhone Valley and the surrounding mountains. At the Gryonne river, you are almost halfway through the hike and you have covered most of the altitude difference. You follow the river until just before it flows into the Rhone, which you cross a little later to arrive in Massongex. The village was the capital of Celtic Valais long ago. Now comes the final hour of the hike to the end of this stage in St. Maurice. Pilgrims walking all the way from Canterbury to Rome are now right in the middle of the route. Shortly before St. Maurice you pass the fairy grotto. The water has worn away the rock here for thousands of years, creating a grotto with a small underground lake and waterfall.",

        "description": "From Vevey the route follows the lake to Villeneuve. The Swiss Museum of Games in the castle at Tour-de-Peilz and famous Schloss Chillon are worth a visit before you reach the Chablais wine region. Am Ostrand des Rhonetals, inmitten der Weinberge des Chablais, beginnt die Wanderung von Aigle nach St. Maurice. Das Quartier du Bourg mit seinen schmalen G\u00e4sschen und H\u00e4usern, die eng beieinander stehen und teils durch Lauben verbunden sind, bildet den Mittelpunkt des St\u00e4dtchens. Bedeutendster Bau von Aigle ist das Schloss, an dem man kurz nach dem Start beim Bahnhof vorbeiwandert. Es wurde im 12. Jhdt. zum Schutz von Aigle erbaut und erm\u00f6glichte die Kontrolle des Zugangs ins Rhonetal und Pays d\u2019Enhaut.  Nach einem kurzen Waldst\u00fcck werden die n\u00e4chsten Weinberge rund um Ollon nach rund eineinhalb Stunden erreicht. Anschliessend wandert man wieder etwas hinauf, um schon bald wieder nach Antagnes abzusteigen. Die Aussicht \u00fcber das Rhonetal und die umliegenden Berge ist herrlich. Beim Fluss La Gryonne ist die H\u00e4lfte der Wanderung geschafft und beinahe schon alle H\u00f6henmeter.  Dem Fluss folgt man bis kurz vor dessen M\u00fcndung in die Rhone, welche man etwas sp\u00e4ter \u00fcberquert, um nach Massongex zu gelangen. Das Dorf war vor langer Zeit die Hauptstadt des keltischen Wallis. Hier folgt die letzte Wanderstunde zum Ziel der Etappe in St. Maurice. Pilger, die den gesamten Weg von Canterbury nach Rom wandern, befinden sich jetzt genau in der Mitte. Kurz vor St. Maurice passiert man die Feengrotte. Das Wasser hat hier den Felsen \u00fcber Jahrtausende ausgesp\u00fclt und die Grotte mit dem kleinen unterirdischen See und einem Wasserfall entstehen lassen. C\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 est de la vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne, au c\u0153ur du vignoble du Chablais, que commence la randonn\u00e9e d\u2019Aigle \u00e0 St-Maurice. Le quartier du Bourg avec ses ruelles \u00e9troites et ses maisons coll\u00e9es les unes aux autres, dont certaines sont reli\u00e9es par des arcades, constitue le point central de la petite ville. L\u2019\u00e9difice le plus important d\u2019Aigle est le ch\u00e2teau que l\u2019on longe peu apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9part de la gare. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit au 12e si\u00e8cle pour prot\u00e9ger Aigle et permettre le contr\u00f4le de l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne et au Pays d\u2019Enhaut. Apr\u00e8s un court passage par la for\u00eat, on atteint les prochains vignobles autour d\u2019Ollon apr\u00e8s environ une heure et demie de marche. Ensuite, on remonte un peu pour redescendre peu apr\u00e8s vers Antagnes. La vue sur la vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne et les montagnes environnantes est magnifique. Au niveau de la rivi\u00e8re la Gryonne, vous avez fait la moiti\u00e9 du chemin et franchi presque tous les m\u00e8tres de d\u00e9nivel\u00e9.  On suit la rivi\u00e8re jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son embouchure dans le Rh\u00f4ne, que vous traversez un peu plus tard pour arriver \u00e0 Massongex. Ce village \u00e9tait il y a fort longtemps la capitale du Valais celtique. Vous vous attaquez d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re heure de marche avant d\u2019arriver \u00e0 St-Maurice, terme de l\u2019\u00e9tape. Les p\u00e8lerins qui effectuent l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019itin\u00e9raire de Canterbury \u00e0 Rome se trouvent ici exactement au milieu du parcours. Peu avant St-Maurice, on passe devant la Grotte aux f\u00e9es. Au cours des mill\u00e9naires, l\u2019eau a creus\u00e9 la roche pour donner naissance \u00e0 cette grotte avec son petit lac souterrain et sa cascade.

From La Plaine, you pass through the villages of Avully, Avusy, S\u00e9zegnin, Soral, Laconnex, Lully and Bardonnex to reach La Croix-de-Rozon. The hike begins just outside the hamlet of Sauverny (F) on the French-Swiss border. The first part follows the meandering course of the Versoix river, which shortly before in France was called Divonne. In this section, the river crosses the Combes Chapuis nature reserve, which is not only a treat for the eyes in itself, but also provides a habitat for a diverse flora and fauna. After leaving the course of the river for a while to explore the forest paths of the Bois de Versoix, you rejoin the lovely stream not far from the Pont de Bossy. On the other bank, there is a picnic area with tables and barbecues. Here and in La B\u00e2tie, the next hamlet along the way, there are fortifications from the Second World War.

The trail leads past the Moulin-de-Richelien, where water power has been used for over 500 years. To this day, a small family-run hydroelectric power station generates electricity here. After winding its way along the Versoix through several meanders in the Gravines forest nature reserve, the trail then follows an irrigation canal built in 1790, the Canal de Versoix. Here, the path is lined by a centuries-old avenue of plane trees, evoking the feeling of a rural journey back in time. Before heading home, you can make a detour to the old chocolate factory, into the village or towards the lake.

Wonderful views from Randen tower into the neighbouring country and from Randenhaus to the Alps. North of the Rhine is the well-kept Schaffhausen wine-growing village of Hallau, nestling in extensive vineyards, farmland and forests. The hike has barely begun when you are already amid the vineyards, and therefore at the heart of Schaffhausen\u2019s Pinot Noir region. The mountain church of St. Moritz towers over the vines; it is both eye-catching and a landmark. You continue on this kind of terrain for almost an hour. Not surprising, because this is the largest borderland vineyard landscape in German-speaking Switzerland. Pinot Noir, Riesling, Chardonnay, Pinot Gris and other grapes grow in the fertile soils.  Half an hour later comes the border with Germany, and it takes about 45 minutes to walk along here to just before St\u00fchlingen. Crossing the Schlaatemerbach stream, you climb up to the next vines and go through Schleitheim. Walking across wide fields, you reach the first range of hills in the Randen. The natural and cultural landscape in the Schaffhausen Regional Nature Park is unique: the Randen hills, the Rhine, the vineyards around Klettgau, the forests, typical villages and the huge agricultural areas give the area its diversity.  You then encounter the ruins of Randenburg Castle and the Schleitheimer Randenturm tower as you go uphill through the forest. The original wooden tower was built in 1872 and replaced with an iron one in 1909. During the Second World War, it served as an observation post for anti-aircraft troops. Today it offers a fantastic view across Switzerland and neighbouring Germany. The ruins consist of just a few tiny remains of two walls. Almost an hour later, you reach the end of this stage at the Randenhaus. The venue, located on the high plateau of the Table Jura, is a popular excursion destination near Schaffhausen.",

        "description": "In the Blauburgunderland at Hallau, the high-level trail leads over the three-armed Randen hill chain, through extensive forests, along the Swiss-German border. Wonderful views from Randen tower into the neighbouring country and from Randenhaus to the Alps. North of the Rhine is the well-kept Schaffhausen wine-growing village of Hallau, nestling in extensive vineyards, farmland and forests. The hike has barely begun when you are already amid the vineyards, and therefore at the heart of Schaffhausen\u2019s Pinot Noir region. The mountain church of St. Moritz towers over the vines; it is both eye-catching and a landmark. You continue on this kind of terrain for almost an hour.

Geology and botany are the focus of this hike. Starting at Neuhausen Rheinfall rail station, the Schaffhausen Border Trail takes you past the roaring waterfall into the silent forests of Schaffhausen's South Randen area. There is evidence that bean ore (limonite) was mined in this region from the 16th century onwards, and probably since Roman times. Pits that were excavated long ago have often become valuable habitats for native animal and plant species today. Along the way, you'll come to the Aazheimerhof, built in 1598 as the farm estate and summer residence of the Abbots of Rheinau. The estate has belonged to the City of Schaffhausen since 1936, and it is farmed and used by tenants. From national boundary stone no. 55, you follow the line of the border. At boundary stone no. 67, an erratic block of rock (also known as the \"Grey Stone\") rises out of a bean ore mine. This is the point where the districts of Beringen, Neunkirch and Jestetten (Germany) meet. The Linth glacier probably transported this huge boulder here from the Glarus or St. Gallen Oberland regions during the Riss glaciation, well over 200,000 years ago. The magnificent forest area between Erlenboden and the Wasen Hut is home to Sika deer, a breed that originated in China.  From the ruins of Radegg Castle, towering over the Wangen Valley on a rocky spur of Rossberg mountain, you will have a beautiful sweeping view of the Klettgau Valley where vines dominate the landscape. The walls of the castle are still visible, and the barbecue area is an inviting spot for a break. Mentioned for the first time in 1472, Bad Osterfingen is known today for its winery and country inn. The villagescape of Osterfingen, which is protected and mentioned in the Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites (ISOS), provides an excellent setting to sample a choice Schaffhausen Pinot Noir.",

The Septimer was one of the most important Alpine passes even in Roman times, but in the High Middle Ages above all, it was a key trading route and brought wealth to the Bishop of Chur.

If you walk from Romoos through the multilayered Napf area, you might suddenly smell smoke or see mysterious wisps rising from between the trees. Not to worry, it is not a forest fire.

Romoos once had around 200 charburning places because blacksmiths, iron foundries and glassworks needed a great deal of charcoal then.

Plenty of time in Goldau for a detour to the animal park. The views from the starting point of this mainly descending route are breathtaking. Enjoy the Alpine chain, Lake Lucerne, Lake Sempach or Lake Zug from the panoramic terrace at Rigi Staffel. Europe's first mountain railway arrived here from Vitznau on 21 May 1871. Today, the Rigi is accessible from all directions thanks to seven cable cars and two cogwheel railways. The trail first leads briefly along the cogwheel railway. Across sparsely wooded pastures and paths, you reach Rigi Kl\u00f6sterli, where you will have already descended 300 metres in altitude. This place of pilgrimage steeped in history was once home to numerous Capuchin monks. The pretty \"Maria zum Schnee\" pilgrimage chapel was built here over 300 years ago, not far from the rushing Rigi Aa, surrounded by characteristic grottos and caves.  The trail continues downhill on a well-surfaced gravel road. It becomes steeper over time and turns into a forest path that zigzags down to the D\u00e4lchli restaurant and continues to Bl\u00e4tzen. With the Kleine and Grosse Mythen before your eyes, you follow the paved road to Goldau. The fun hike ends at Arth-Goldau railway station, a vital railway junction on the Gotthard line. Arth-Goldau is located between Lake Zug and Lake Lauerz in the canton of Schwyz. Today, the alluvial fan of a massive rockslide is home to the renowned Goldau Wildlife Park. On 42 hectares of pristine nature with huge boulders, you can observe more than a hundred European wild animal species, such as bears, wolves, foxes, bearded vultures and owls, from up close. Arth-Goldau lies in the heart of a cherry-tree region. The blossoming season in spring provides a lovely and unique nature experience.",

The quiet resort of Kandersteg with a population of about 1000 is located at the foot of the L\u00f6tschen Pass.

The \u201cbread tree\u201d \u2013 as it was known, due to its importance \u2013 is now being recognized as having played a crucial role in peasant culture of past centuries, and experts are beginning to appraise its worth as an important piece of local history. In 1999 the Association of Swiss Italian chestnut farmers (Associazione dei castanicoltori della Svizzera Italiana) was established, with the intent of raising awareness about the history, culture, cultivation methods, consumption and trade of the chestnut, not to mention organizing the harvesting. Furthermore, monumental chestnut trees are being inventoried and several chestnut woods are in the process of being recovered.

After the descent through the forest, the route follows the lovely Turtm\u00e4nna creek back to Gruben/Meiden. The unspoiled Turtmann Valley is situated between the Turmtann Glacier in the south and the Rhone in the north. It is the western-most German-speaking southern valley in the Valais.

High above Sion in one of Switzerland\u2019s driest regions is the Grand Bisse d'Ayent irrigation channel. Built in 1442 it draws water directly from the Lienne river below the wall of the Tseuzier dam (1777 m). The historic water conduit which is explored on this hike, irrigates the hills and vineyards of the towns of Ayent and Grimisuat. It carries water between June and October. The start near the dam can be reached by taking public transportation from Sion. The first 2 km or so in the Lienne Valley are very steep. Since the dam was completed in 1957, the upper part of the Bisse has been drained, but traces of the channel are still evident along the way. The Les Foll\u00e9s passage where the channel follows the rocky ridge is not for the faint-hearted. It is not recommended for anyone who suffers from vertigo. After the Le Samarin bus stop, where the trail crosses the road, the channel carries water. The path now follows the burbling channel with a gradient of only 1.5 \u2030 in some places.  But then the spectacular part begins: a passage of symbolic importance of this channel is the one in the rock face of Torrent-Croix. The incredible work of our forefathers is particularly striking here. They built the conduit on the mountainside with their bare hands, just a narrow channel made of boards and hugging the rocks. It was replaced in 1831 with a 95-m tunnel through which the water now flows. In 2019 the old channel was memorialised on the Swiss 100-franc bill and now the meaning is mostly sentimental. Still, this passage is head-spinning because there is a hole in the middle of the tunnel leading to a platform. The entire structure outside of the mountain can be clearly seen from there and it makes us understand the dangers to which the builders were exposed.

The hike into the Muotathal valley begins on the sunny terrace with great views over the Sch\u00e4chental valley, surrounded by magnificent mountain scenery. Hikers must climb about 500 metres to Chinzig Chulm (2,073 metres above sea level). After one and a half hours, you have made it. The summit panorama is also spectacular from the top of the pass, with the Rossstock, Chaiserstock, Hoch Pfaffen and Gl\u00e4rnisch in plain sight. Suvorov's troops set out towards the Chinzig Pass on 27 September at around five o'clock in the morning under the command of Prince Bagration. Despite insufficient supplies and equipment, they reached the pass, where a small chapel stands, around noon. However, the 22,000 Russians who were led over the pass into the Muotathal saw nothing of the surrounding mountains and the magnificent panoramic views. It was rainy and cold. After the pass, hikers descend via Chinzertal and W\u00e4ngi into the H\u00fcrlital valley. The latter is reached after about two hours. The path to the Muotathal steepens again here, with a 600-metre descent over a distance of three kilometres.  Despite the poor weather, Suvorov's first troops advanced from the H\u00fcrlital towards Muotathal around three o'clock in the afternoon. The unexpected appearance of the strange figures left a lasting impression on the population. The French did not expect the Russians to advance over the Chinzig Pass. They were taken by surprise, leading to roughly one company's capture. Some Frenchmen managed to escape to Schwyz. Village priest Lukas Geisser recalls the events: After the French had been put to flight, two horsemen armed with spears, sabres, and a pistol headed up the hill towards him. Another 30 soldiers soon followed them. The officer leading them came up to him, opened his uniform jacket and showed him the large cross on his chest.

Guarda is a typical Unterengadin village. Scuol lies in the wide valley basin of the Inn between the Silvretta Group's mountain ranges in the north and the Engadine Dolomites in the south. Shielded by these mighty mountain ranges, the town is known for its sunny and dry climate. The stage starts at the Scuol-Tarasp railway station and briefly follows the gondola lift, which runs up to the Motta Naluns area.  The hike also leads uphill. You reach Ftan on a gravel road with fantastic views of the peaks to the west. The village burned down almost entirely several times. In the alley of Rontsch, you can easily recognise the different types of architecture. To the north are the typical Engadine houses. Opposite, the palazzi were built by wealthy returnees from the confectionery trade.  Gravel roads and paths lead through dreamy stretches of forest and past huge boulders. Crossing the Tasna valley over a beautiful arched stone bridge, you reach the over thousand-year-old Chanoua ruins. They are arguably the most important structure of a small hamlet. It may have served as a hostel and goods transfer point in earlier times.  A short while later, you reach the well-preserved village of Ardez. Situated on a plateau on the southern slope, Ardez is a model village of the Rhaeto-Romanic language and housing culture. Steep cobblestone streets run between the stately farmhouses with their typically painted and decorated fa\u00e7ades. The village is surrounded by lush meadows and mixed forests.  An asphalt road now leads gently uphill again. With magnificent views of the surrounding mountains of the National Park, you cross Bos-cha with its \"Funtauna da San Giacun\" (St. James spring) and reach Guarda, the village of Schellen-Ursli, one of Switzerland's most famous picture books, which was also made into a film. In the traffic-free \"most beautiful end of the world\", the well-kept and richly decorated Engadine houses and the silence of the mountains are striking.",

Shielded by these mighty mountain ranges, the town is known for its sunny and dry climate. The stage starts at the Scuol-Tarasp railway station and briefly follows the gondola lift, which runs up to the Motta Naluns area.  The hike also leads uphill. You reach Ftan on a gravel road with fantastic views of the peaks to the west. The village burned down almost entirely several times. In the alley of Rontsch, you can easily recognise the different types of architecture. To the north are the typical Engadine houses. Opposite, the palazzi were built by wealthy returnees from the confectionery trade.  Gravel roads and paths lead through dreamy stretches of forest and past huge boulders. Crossing the Tasna valley over a beautiful arched stone bridge, you reach the over thousand-year-old Chanoua ruins. They are arguably the most important structure of a small hamlet. It may have served as a hostel and goods transfer point in earlier times.  A short while later, you reach the well-preserved village of Ardez. Situated on a plateau on the southern slope, Ardez is a model village of the Rhaeto-Romanic language and housing culture. Steep cobblestone streets run between the stately farmhouses with their typically painted and decorated fa\u00e7ades. The village is surrounded by lush meadows and mixed forests.  An asphalt road now leads gently uphill again. With magnificent views of the surrounding mountains of the National Park, you cross Bos-cha with its \"Funtauna da San Giacun\" (St. James spring) and reach Guarda, the village of Schellen-Ursli, one of Switzerland's most famous picture books, which was also made into a film. In the traffic-free \"most beautiful end of the world\", the well-kept and richly decorated Engadine houses and the silence of the mountains are striking."

The population christened the anti-tank blocks \u00abToblerones\u00bb because their shape recalls a Swiss chocolate brand. Its name might suggest otherwise, but the Toblerone Trail will appeal more to history-lovers than those with a sweet tooth. \"Toblerones\" was the popular name for the tank traps set up as defensive lines between Bassins and Nyon in the second world war. Their triangular shape recalls the \"peaks\" of a Toblerone chocolate bar, and that explains the name given to the 3,000 or so concrete triangles \u2013 each as tall as a man. The \"Toblerones\" are arrayed along a stretch of about ten kilometers between the Jura foothills and Lake Geneva. An educational trail focusing on history follows the traps. Around 1940, when German troops were attacking neutral countries such as Belgium and Norway, fears also reached very high levels in Switzerland. This prompted the start of construction work on the \"Promenthouse Defence Line\": chunks of concrete were set up one after another along the courses of rivers and streams. Instead of removing them again, some were restored as a reminder of the war's importance for Switzerland. But military history is only one interesting aspect of the hike along these \"Toblerones\". This is also a paradise for nature-lovers: the massive tank traps tend to prevent intensive cultivation of the land, so they are now wreathed in moss and ivy \u2013 a welcoming habitat for many plants and animals. Birds chirrup along the streams and above the canopy of greenery. From the fields, you can admire the views of Lake Geneva and the French Alps.  There are also some fascinating buildings along the way, such as the Villa Rose near Gland (a listed monument). This two-storey building is painted pale pink with green shutters. But Villa Rose is not a cosy home: in fact, it is an ingeniously designed fortress. The windows turn out to be fake, and even the toilet has disguised slits for shooting at the enemy! On reaching the shore of Lake Geneva, the route crosses the golf course of the Domaine Imp\u00e9rial club. There is an air of grandeur about the clubhouse here. No wonder: Napoleon's family once used it as a villa. The beach near Prangins brings this outing to an enchanting conclusion. A visit to the Swiss National Museum in Prangins Castle is also worthwhile \u2013 and, of course, a stroll through the pretty historic centre of Nyon, overlooked by the towers of Nyon castle.",

The Maderaner valley is registered in the Swiss federal inventory of landscapes and natural monuments and is famous for its wealth of high alpine scenery, its beautiful mineral rocks and red deer, as well as its picturesque waterfalls. The wild roaring river of Ch\u00e4rstelen flows through the valley which, combined with its wild streams and abundance of herb and flower meadows, shining glaciers and variously shaped mountain peaks, makes it one of the most scenic high valleys of Switzerland. The gondola Bristen-Golzern saves hikers the two-hour hike up to the start point of the high-altitude track \u00abMaderanertal\u00bb. From the gondola station the hamlet of Seewen is reached without much effort on the well developed track. That old group of houses including two restaurants is close to the deep blue lake of Golzern. The track continues above the lake in direction to the Windg\u00e4llenh\u00fctte AACZ. Above W\u00fcrzen at the signposted view point you can see the mountain hotel Maderanertal, which in its time was world famous due to its spectacular location. The high-altitude track then leads through lightly forested mountain side to Steinmannli and from there half an hour up to the Windg\u00e4llenh\u00fctte AACZ. The Windg\u00e4llenh\u00fctte AACZ towards Balmenegg the high-altitude track offers terrific views of the glacier and the surrounding majestic 3000 m high mountain peaks. Most impressive are the smooth rock towers of Chalchschijen and massive the solid rock bastions of Gross Windg\u00e4llen, Pucher and of the Gross Ruchen. Also the mountain flora is not understated. A colourful carpet of beautiful alpine flowers borders our high-altitude track. From Tritt the track leads down about a dozen bends to Balmenegg and the mountain hotel, where hikers can stop and rest. From here the track goes down to Balmenschachen and the alp St\u00f6ssi, where you can buy fine cheese at the small St\u00f6ssi cheese factory. Following that, the sign points you towards the historical valley track which leads to L\u00e4gni via Lungenberg. Completing the track you walk along the wild roaring river of Ch\u00e4rstelen down to the valley station of the gondola.",

        "description": "The valley of Maderanertal, world famous due to its natural beauty, opens up in Amsteg and the towering peak of Chli Windg\u00e4llen and winds itself east ways towards the imposing Huefi glacier, always surrounded by high alpine mountain peaks. The Maderaner valley is registered in the Swiss federal inventory of landscapes and natural monuments and is famous for its wealth of high alpine scenery, its beautiful mineral rocks and red deer, as well as its picturesque waterfalls. The wild roaring river of Ch\u00e4rstelen flows through the valley which, combined with its wild streams and abundance of herb and flower meadows, shining glaciers and variously shaped mountain peaks, makes it one of the most scenic high valleys of Switzerland.

Over a rock barrier to the lake plateau of Melchsee-Frutt at a lofty altitude, goal of rest and recreation seekers in summer and winter. Br\u00fcnig Pass, known for the famous Swiss wrestling competition, connects Central Switzerland with the Bernese Oberland. With an altitude of just 1002 m the pass is open all year and popular with motorcycle riders. This stage begins at the cogwheel railway station and requires a bit of stamina. Accompanied by blossoming Alpine meadows, a view of sparkling Lake Lungern and all the way to the mountains of the Bernese Oberland, it takes about three hours to reach H\u00fcttstett. The first ascent of this stage is now behind you and the path begins to go down to the Melchtal Valley. Across Alp Chrummelbach with its lovely Alpine chapel and over the Small Melchaa, the trail continues on the other side of the valley through forests and meadows and leads up to the central point of Switzerland. By now you have been hiking for about five hours.  The geographic centre of Switzerland was established in 1988 at \u00c4lggi-Alp using the latest measuring technology, i.e. a triangulation pyramid. At that time, Switzerland\u2019s Federal Office of Topology celebrated its 150-year anniversary. A stone wall in the shape of Switzerland was constructed around the centre. The country\u2019s exact geographic centre is actually located further to the southeast, but because it is not easily accessible right above a rocky cliff, the location was shifted by about 500 meters.

Part of the forest trail runs through the narrow valley between steep cliffs, climbs high above the gorge and passes through several tunnels.

At an altitude of almost 1,500 m the valley opens up for the first time and Alp Uina Dadora comes into view. After another uphill section between coniferous trees and scree slopes you reach Alp Uina Dadaint where you may want to take a break at the mountain restaurant. The steep cliffs of the Uina Gorge are visible in the south.  Between Piz Rims and Piz da Gliasen a 600 m long path was blasted into the limestone rock wall to create a passage through the gorge. The path is about a meter wide and part of it runs below the projecting rock face. In some places it is secured with ropes and handrails. You also pass through two short, but unlit tunnels, high above the river. You must be surefooted here and have no fear of heights. As late as the 1970s, coffee and cigarettes were smuggled to the Italian South Tyrol on this trail. You continue on a path leading through broad Alpine pastures where the cattle is peacefully grazing. Numerous creeks are flowing through the high valley. Near the national border, at an altitude of about 2,300 m, you reach the Schlinig moorland with its clear mountain lakes.

If you wish to travel to the Gotthard Pass the way they did in the times of the legendary Gotthard stagecoach in the mid-19th century, book a trip with the old, five-horse post coach. Or go even further back in time and choose the footpath. The muleteers transported their goods on this route as far back as the 13th century.

Nowadays cars are held up in traffic jams before they get to the tunnel, but for hikers the way is clear. A comfortable flat trail leads through the romantic Urseren Valley between Andermatt and Hospental. Along the Reuss and past the Alpine golf course of Andermatt you reach Hospental, the last stop before the path begins to climb. The town benefited from the busy traffic in the olden days as the many inns and the old customs station show.

From Liestal railway station, the route takes a detour through the historic town past the Wehrmannsbrunnen (fountain), the Gothic city hall and to the upper gate dating back to the 13th century. Along the second leg of Via Gottardo, the focus is on railway history: Your first stop is at the Frenkenbr\u00fccke industrial monument, Switzerland\u2019s oldest preserved railway bridge. In 2005, the last train crossed this 1854-built wrought-and-cast-iron truss bridge. At Altmarkt, known for its ancient crossing keeper\u2019s hut, the rails of SBB and Waldenburger line separate. Nevertheless, Lausen plays a vital role in freight service. Here the route briefly leaves the valley bottom and climbs up to the reservoir. With views of the railway line, you reach Itingen and its compact row houses.  Less compact is the imposing, late-Baroque Ebenrain Castle at the entrance to Sissach. Built as a country estate by Basel-based silk manufacturer Martin Bachofen in 1774/75, it nowadays serves the Regierungsrat (cantonal government) as a venue for receptions. The park, courtyard and veranda are accessible to the public. At Sissach, the main SBB line Basel-Olten via the Hauenstein base tunnel separates from the old Hauenstein line, which will take centre stage for the rest of the hike. The old Hauenstein Tunnel is considered Switzerland\u2019s first mountain tunnel and was even celebrated as the \u201cfallen barrier of global transport\u201d back in 1858.

In addition to the Hauenstein summit tunnel itself, the viaduct near R\u00fcmlingen is particularly impressive. It is 128 metres long and consists of eight arches.

This stage begins with a stairway-like descent. Heading south, the path follows the mountain stream Salentze and takes you down from Cabane de Rambert to Saille hut in three sections \u2013 via Plan Coupel and Le Pessot, a waterfall in the Salentze (1,790m). As could be expected, the path is steep next to the waterfall. From here, you can reach the spa resort of Ovronnaz in 30 minutes.  \u00a0 The route separates off from the path to Ovronnaz, crossing the stream Salentze and heading up towards Bougnone (1,864m). When you reach Alp Bougnone, the route traverses woods and meadows at roughly the same altitude to reach Petit-Pr\u00e9 (1,996m). There\u2019s a line of four stone huts in the midst of the blossoming meadow. A huge sign with the words G\u00eete Lui d\u2019ao\u00fbt points the way to a hut on a pretty terrace nestled amongst the mountains, where you can quench your thirst. This hut is managed by Saillon ski club. Then you turn your back on Seya (2,181m) and Lui d\u2019ao\u00fbt, and head off towards Les Grand-Pr\u00e9s d\u2019Euloi. The path passes some cliffs on the left and then leads up the steep scree slope of Combe du Fenestral to Pass Fenestral (2,453m).  \u00a0 A unique natural spectacle awaits: small lakes sparkling between grey rocks and emerald green Alpine meadows. Three of the area\u2019s highest mountains, Tita S\u00e8ri (2,850m) and Dent de Morcles (2,970m) to the right and Chavalard (2,898m) to the left, stand guard over the pass. Cabane du Fenestral, which is owned by Fully ski club, is a few metres below the pass. Chatting with the hut\u2019s warden over a glass of wine, you\u2019ll quickly forget the rigours of the ascent. The path drops down to the reservoir, which you can skirt round on the left or the right. A 20-minute detour to the newly renovated Cabane de Sorniot (2,064m) on Alp Sorniot is very worthwhile. Depending on the season, you\u2019ll see black H\u00e9rens fighting cows grazing there with their \u201cqueen\u201d.  \u00a0 Back at the reservoir, you can rejoin the path that leads to Cabane de Dem\u00e8cre. This hut has been completely renovated by the Fully-based association \u201cLes Trotteurs\u201d.

        "description": "Unspoilt nature every step of the way. You walk past streams, lakes and even a waterfall on this memorable stage of the Tour des Muverans. This stage begins with a stairway-like descent. Heading south, the path follows the mountain stream Salentze and takes you down from Cabane de Rambert to Saille hut in three sections \u2013 via Plan Coupel and Le Pessot, a waterfall in the Salentze (1,790m). As could be expected, the path is steep next to the waterfall. From here, you can reach the spa resort of Ovronnaz in 30 minutes.  \u00a0 The route separates off from the path to Ovronnaz, crossing the stream Salentze and heading up towards Bougnone (1,864m). When you reach Alp Bougnone, the route traverses woods and meadows at roughly the same altitude to reach Petit-Pr\u00e9 (1,996m). There\u2019s a line of four stone huts in the midst of the blossoming meadow. A huge sign with the words G\u00eete Lui d\u2019ao\u00fbt points the way to a hut on a pretty terrace nestled amongst the mountains, where you can quench your thirst. This hut is managed by Saillon ski club. Then you turn your back on Seya (2,181m) and Lui d\u2019ao\u00fbt, and head off towards Les Grand-Pr\u00e9s d\u2019Euloi. The path passes some cliffs on the left and then leads up the steep scree slope of Combe du Fenestral to Pass Fenestral (2,453m).  \u00a0 A unique natural spectacle awaits: small lakes sparkling between grey rocks and emerald green Alpine meadows. Three of the area\u2019s highest mountains, Tita S\u00e8ri (2,850m) and Dent de Morcles (2,970m) to the right and Chavalard (2,898m) to the left, stand guard over the pass. Cabane du Fenestral, which is owned by Fully ski club, is a few metres below the pass. Chatting with the hut\u2019s warden over a glass of wine, you\u2019ll quickly forget the rigours of the ascent. The path drops down to the reservoir, which you can skirt round on the left or the right. A 20-minute detour to the newly renovated Cabane de Sorniot (2,064m) on Alp Sorniot is very worthwhile. Depending on the season, you\u2019ll see black H\u00e9rens fighting cows grazing there with their \u201cqueen\u201d.  \u00a0 Back at the reservoir, you can rejoin the path that leads to Cabane de Dem\u00e8cre. This hut has been completely renovated by the Fully-based association \u201cLes Trotteurs\u201d. You are amply rewarded for today\u2019s hike with fabulous views across to Mont Blanc and the Dents du Midi and down the Rhone Valley to Lake Geneva. \u00a0"

The old, renovated Valais houses as well as an old mill and the Backhaus all bear witness to past times and the living conditions of the village residents. T\u00e4sch was not always at the same location. T\u00e4sch was buried under a massive rockslide at T\u00e4schgufer sometime before 1400 according to the handed down tradition. The village was rebuilt at its present location around 1400. In the local dialect, \u201cGufer\u201d means \u201cscree\u201d or \u201crubble.\u201d \u00a0 The Trufferhaus is one of the most valuable buildings in the village. It was built in 1766 and is therefore one of the village\u2019s oldest structures. It is an example of the true Valais style with the south side timbered on wood and the north side built on stonework. It has been renovated but is not occupied. Here the Kronig brothers once lived who worked as blacksmiths, saddlers and coopers. Later, the building was the home of the Truffer family. Other renovated Valais houses in the village are beautiful subjects for those taking photographs. \u00a0 Wherever one looks, large and small buildings can be seen that have the typical dark, weathered larch wood colouring. Until 1950, most of the residents made their living from farming. Barns, granaries and stables were their farm buildings. These are wooden structures for grain, stocks, provisions, cows and small animals. The barns are built on round, stone slabs, which keep the mice out. Granaries served as storage space for food, grain, flour and dried meat. \u00a0 The catchment area of the stream reaches from the slopes of the Rothorn over the Rimpfischhorn to the Alphubel, all of which are mighty four thousand-metre peaks. The stream has behaved accordingly: it has been the cause of flooding several times: 1870, 1957 and 2001. Construction measures at Weingartensee, on T\u00e4schalp and in the streambed have quieted the stream. The Mattertal is a low precipitation valley. Therefore, it can happen that the waterfall at the beginning of the village is just a trickle. \u00a0 Two old wooden structures always draw attention.

En route: spectacular views of the Leventina Valley with extended motorway entry and exit points. This stage begins on Switzerland\u2019s most important Alpine pass at over 2100 m. The scenery at the top is unforgettable. No wonder it is jam-packed with tourists during the summer months. Some take selfies at the sparkling mountain lakes, while others step back in time and visit the national St. Gotthard Museum or the Sasso San Gottardo defence installation. Few people know that the Gotthard Pass is also an important water divide with the sources of Rhine, Rhone, Reuss and Ticino all within this area.  Just a couple of minutes on the historic mule trail and the clamour is behind you. Heading south toward Airolo you pass the Chapel of the Dead and then the partly paved mule trail meanders down and across meadows scattered with rocks. Soon you will spot the world-famous Tremola road. The landmarked mountain pass is one of the highlights of today\u2019s hike. It descends 340 altitude meters through 24 turns. Post coaches used to clatter down the road in the olden days. Now it is popular with mountain bikers and motorcycle riders. The hikers are very close to this impressive structure, which is perfectly embedded in the terrain. They cross this awe-inspiring road with retaining walls of as much as 8 m multiple times and in some places they even walk on it. Mother Nature is also part of the scenery: while the roar of an engine might occasionally disturb the peace, you will also hear marmots whistling nearby and if you pay attention, you\u2019ll even see a few away from the road. The upper part of the route is all about the old road and the muleteers, but the second section represents a different time. You see the Gotthard highway down in the valley and the new road across the pass. Crossing under a viaduct brings the former Motto Bartola defence structure into view, now a Swiss Army base. A narrow mountain trail leads past it and continues through meadows and short forest areas. The last section of the path down to Airolo offers a fantastic view of the Leventina Valley and the surrounding mountains. The trail passes through the lovely old town centre with its winding lanes and heads for the train station below. Airolo is a crossroads of traffic routes from different eras: the old 13th century mule track, the old railway tunnel which opened in 1882 and the Gotthard road tunnel, built approximately 100 years later. A monument by artist Vincenzo Vela near the train station honours the workmen who died during the construction of the railway tunnel.",

Karst landscape on R\u00e4tschenjoch, former mining area in \u00abButzchammera\u00bb, rockfall landscape in Gafital, scattered settlements on the slopes, at the end a closed-off settlement in St. Ant\u00f6nien Platz. Klosters, a chalet-style alpine resort, lies at the top of the Pr\u00e4ttigau. The village's 800-year history has been shaped by Walserism. The tough, hard-working Walser people are said to have been good-natured, direct, freedom-loving and in tune with nature. With their hard work, they shaped the landscape and people of Graub\u00fcnden. From Klosters railway station, the well-secured trail zigzags steeply up the Schlappintobel. The mountain stream flows below the path. For a few metres, the route continues along Schlappinsee lake, which invites you to fish, splash around and linger. After the tiny Walser settlement of Schlappin, the trail branches off to the left and continues uphill, albeit somewhat less steeply.  Continuing through a fairy-tale forest with beautiful streams, giant mushrooms and lush green grass, you leave the tree line behind. It is worth looking to the east, where the Schlappiner valley now opens up. Wine and cattle, among other things, were traded via the mule track over the Schlappiner-Joch. In 1622, this was a war zone during a conflict between Graub\u00fcnden and Montafon.   Along the steep slope, you reach the Z\u00fcgenh\u00fcttli. At the next junction, the trail continues to the right. Turning left would take you to the Madrisa cable car with its adventure park for families. The long stage could be divided into two parts here.  Further uphill, past the Obers\u00e4ss, you reach the Ch\u00fcecalanda, where the marmots sound the alarm if you get too close. In the back, you can see the three-thousand-metre peaks of the Grisons Alps, the Weissfluh above Klosters and the Pischahorn above Davos. The lush pastures contrast with the stony Saaser-Calanda and the R\u00e4tschenhorn. The hike's highest point is reached at 2,601 metres above sea level. On the R\u00e4tschenjoch, fantastic panoramic views open up to the north and south. The white Gafier Platte suddenly appears right in front of you.  Following the ascent via a lush green southern slope, the route descends again across a gravel landscape on the northern slope. Metre by metre, the scenery turns greener as you leave the Gafier slabs behind you. Affording views of the Madrisajoch and the Gafier Joch, the route continues. A little later, the Sulzfluh and the Drusenfluh are visible to the north. The latter two mountains are suitable for climbing.  Shortly before Hochstelli, at the source of the Gafierbach stream, you look down into the valley over the steeply dropping Plattenfluh. Following along the creek, you reach the Sunnistafel. Rockfalls characterise the primaeval landscape in the lower part of the Gafia valley, making farming difficult. It is still the most important economic sector in the high valley of St. Ant\u00f6nien. This very long, impressive and varied stage ends here.",

Moutier, the capital of the Bernese Jura, lies between two impressive gorges of the Faltenjura (Jura folds) in the valley basin of the Birs. Surrounded by deep valleys, gorges and wild nature, the town has much to offer with its cobblestone streets. The first machine tools were built here, and industry continues to play a vital role here. The route starts in the east of Moutier at the railway station. Along the Birs, you cross the town, reach La Chali\u00e8re and then branch off to the left to follow the pretty little La Foule stream into a gorge. Wooded rocky slopes rise to the left and right, and at a bend, you suddenly find yourself directly in front of a massive, round rock face. Continue on a narrow path through the forest and past old military installations to reach Gorges de Court.  Here the Birs flows through a rocky gorge, and the route initially runs parallel to the road for about five minutes. After an underpass, continue along the banks of the Birs, where the rushing water drowns out the noise of the road. Polished and moss-covered stones lie between the roots of the trees and their branches in the riverbed. In places, the path leads directly along massive rock faces. A narrow pedestrian tunnel in the rock and wooden footbridges make the passage easier.  Behind the gorge, you reach Court. The path branches off to the right and crosses the steep slope at the forest edge north of the village. On beautiful flower meadows, you can see over the Vall\u00e9e de Tavannes. Behind Champoz, the steep climb on the Moron begins. Through the forest, you reach the broad ridge. Dead-straight dry-stone walls stretch across the hills, where several mountain farms lie between extensive Jura pastures.  The route continues on a gravel road with a reduced gradient to the Moron Tower. The observation tower, designed by Mario Botta, offers panoramic views of the Alps, the Chasseral, Mont Soleil and the Black Forest. Because several steps broke off in 2022, the tower had to be temporarily closed (as of summer 2023). At an altitude of 1,319 metres, the hike's highest point is reached.

        "text": "Weg der Schweiz, Stage 2/4 Many spots with views of the Urnersee lake in all its splendour. Interesting and impressive houses between Seelisberg and Bauen as well as at Seedorf. Plenty of places for refreshment and playgrounds en route. At ten kilometres, the second stage of the Swiss Path is the longest, but as it follows the shore of the lake, it is also the easiest. On the section between Isleten and Fl\u00fcelen, the lakeside path is fully accessible, making it possible for wheelchair users to enjoy the cultural trail. The stage begins in Bauen, where the gables of its traditional central Swiss farmhouses face towards the lake.  Lush gardens are home to palm trees, fig trees and other exotic plants. Narrow alleyways, terracing walls and small squares emphasise the Mediterranean panache, thanks to its lakeside location and frequent Foehn winds. Another special feature is that the village is vehicle-free and can only be reached via water by public transport. Following the lake shore, you leave Bauen in a southerly direction. The hillside is overgrown with dense forest and becomes so steep that the trail continues through the mountain. You will find yourself in cool rock galleries with stunning views of Lake Uri. Part of the route on long wooden footbridges along the shore also runs parallel with the road.

        "description": "Many spots with views of the Urnersee lake in all its splendour. Interesting and impressive houses between Seelisberg and Bauen as well as at Seedorf. Plenty of places for refreshment and playgrounds en route. At ten kilometres, the second stage of the Swiss Path is the longest, but as it follows the shore of the lake, it is also the easiest. On the section between Isleten and Fl\u00fcelen, the lakeside path is fully accessible, making it possible for wheelchair users to enjoy the cultural trail. The stage begins in Bauen, where the gables of its traditional central Swiss farmhouses face towards the lake.  Lush gardens are home to palm trees, fig trees and other exotic plants. Narrow alleyways, terracing walls and small squares emphasise the Mediterranean panache, thanks to its lakeside location and frequent Foehn winds. Another special feature is that the village is vehicle-free and can only be reached via water by public transport. Following the lake shore, you leave Bauen in a southerly direction. The hillside is overgrown with dense forest and becomes so steep that the trail continues through the mountain. You will find yourself in cool rock galleries with stunning views of Lake Uri. Part of the route on long wooden footbridges along the shore also runs parallel with the road.

Sainte-Croix in the Vaud Jura is easy to reach by narrow-gauge railway. In the 19th century, this was the global centre of music box production. Modern-day visitors can admire the historic collection at the Centre International de M\u00e9canique d\u2019Art (CIMA) on guided tours. Until Vuiteboeuf, the stage follows the historic salt road (Via Salina), which reaches its high point some way beyond Le Ch\u00e2teau. But first comes the hard work: the first section of about two kilometres runs along a main road, making the view of Lake Neuch\u00e2tel even more beautiful. After about an hour, hikers reach one of the most significant preserved medieval road systems in Switzerland. The longest cart track of its time can still be found in the dense beech forest on the steep descent. Thanks to the channels carved into the Jura limestone, the muleteers were able to drive their salt-laden ox carts over the steep terrain until the 19th century. In 2014, the historic salt road was turned into an educational trail. Information boards tell the story of this important traffic artery between France and Switzerland dating back to the 13th century. After the steep descent on a narrow forest path, the route runs on mostly flat terrain through the sweeping agricultural land of the Jura plain. From the village of Vuiteboeuf with 500 inhabitants where waggoners once changed their horses, it skirts the forest at the foot of the \u201cRapilles de Baulmes\u201d cliff. The sound of chirping birds now replaces the engine noise heard on the historic section near the road. After just under an hour, the trail reaches the little village of Baulmes. It leaves the Jura chain behind, crossing huge arable fields and passing by cattle herds and farms. After almost an hour-and-a-half, it reaches Switzerland\u2019s oldest controlled wine-growing area: the C\u00f4tes de l\u2019Orbe. Between the wine villages of Rances and Valeyres-sous-Rances, the path winds its way through the vineyards and down the southern slope. The view from the church of Saint-Jacques (14/15th century) above Valeyres-sous-Rances sweeps across the gently rolling hills of the C\u00f4tes de l\u2019Orbe to Lake Geneva in the distance. An even older church, probably from the 10th century, can be found in Montcherand. The walls inside this Cluniac place of worship are adorned by the oldest figurative frescos in Switzerland. In the final part of the stage, hikers leave the wide trail at the hydroelectric power station in Montcherand and enter a dense forest traversed by narrow paths. Crossing the Orbe Gorge (Gorges de l\u2019Orbe) over a small suspension bridge is an impressive experience. After hiking along the little river Orbe for just under an hour, we reach the small medieval town of the same name. Besides the old town, it\u2019s well worth visiting the palace square on a hill with its round tower built in 1233. The view from up here stretches across the Plaine de l\u2019Orbe to Mont Blanc.",

Easily accessible by public transport, the path is signposted with brown-colored signs (Sentiero storico 1). From this village, which owes its name to its mineral-rich thermal waters, you can walk towards Corzoneso where you can visit the beautiful church dedicated to Saint Nazzaro and Saint Celso, embellished by stuccos and frescoes. Further along the trail, you will reach the hamlet of Casserio, where the Donetta Archives are housed in a round building, formerly home of photographer Roberto Donetta (1865-1932) who divided his time between his passion for photography and several run-of-the-mill jobs to support his large family. He worked as seeds pedlar and, in winter, as a \u201cmarronaio\u201d (chestnut seller), migrating, like his fellow villagers, to northern Italy. He lived and died in great poverty. His plates were only recovered recently and his photographs, of enormous historic value, are now on display in his \"Round House\".  (For opening hours visit  ). After leaving Corzoneso, continue onwards to Mount Navone (770 meters), an idyllic place where, amidst vast meadows, you will come across several interesting rustic buildings and a chapel dedicated to Santa Maria Bambina. This unique, octagonal, Baroque-style-building hosts several paintings depicting the life of the Virgin Mary. The trail then descends to Semione, through forests and meadows offering beautiful views over the villages in the valley below. With its bell tower, its churchyard hosting the chapels of the \u2018Via Crucis\u2019, an 18th century cross and the Chapel of the Deceased, the recently restored village church forms an architectural ensemble of great beauty and artistic value. In particular, standouts include the frescoes in the chapel, several of which are thought to have been painted by artists of the Seregnesi school (15th century). The village also boasts several picturesque houses built in the late 19th and early 20th century by emigrants who had returned to their homeland.  While walking along this historic path, make sure to stop and admire the ruins of the Serravalle Castle. Overlooking the rocky promontory, surrounded by lush green countryside, partially covered by vineyards, you will find the remains of several of its grey walls testifying the storied past of this stronghold. These are now object of study and restoration. The church of the castle, situated just a little lower down, houses 16th century frescoes by Giovanni Battista Tarilli Cureglia. Continue along the path and follow the signs leading to Ludiano, an area abounding in vineyards and grottoes boasting an ancient 18th century lever wine press. At this point, a stop at the grotto is an absolute must! A short detour will take you to the discovery of the beautiful San Pietro di Motto church. The Romanesque building dates from the 13th century and was expanded in the 16th century. Enter the woods to reach the chapel of Santa Maria del Monastero, also known as San Martino Viduale. The area once hosted a hospice for wayfarers who undertook the long journey, either travelling from north to south through the Lucomagno pass or arriving from the Nara pass. Legend has it that Martino Rossi, a native of Blenio, actually worked here, later going on to become the most famous chef of the Italian Quattrocento (namely the 15th century). Once back on the path, before returning to the starting point in Acquarossa, you will come across the charming Romanesque church of San Remigio (11th century), located in the hamlet of Boscero.

The Tibetan bridge appears almost at the end of the path, thin and elegant. Of breath-taking, scenic impact, the bridge measures 270 metres in length and is suspended 130 metres above the creek below. A walkway with 728 larch boards, a safety wire mesh on the sides, and a handrail make crossing it much easier and safer. For those who do not feel dizzy, the middle of the bridge is the right place to admire a beautiful panorama including the   Plain, the mountains and, in the distance, the Castles of Bellinzona. After passing the Tibetan bridge the path crosses a pretty arduous area before reaching the church of San Bernardo, a monument of national value. This small Romanesque church stands in a clearing in the woods. Though seemingly isolated, it was once an active part of village life. Its origins date back to the late 11th century. The interior is architecturally simple, but rich in 14th and 15th century frescoes covering virtually all of the walls. The painting of the Last Supper is especially interesting owing to the fact that the artist featured local products, including freshwater crabs and cherries, on the table. Should the little church be closed, you will find its keys a little further, in Curz\u00fatt, either at the hostel or at the restaurant.  The old cluster of Curz\u00fatt, situated at an altitude of 600 metres, lies just a short distance from the church and boasts a restaurant. In past centuries, people did not live on the Plains as they do today, but rather on the hills. This, not only because the Ticino River frequently overflowed, meaning that those living along its banks were at greater risk of contracting malaria, but also to avoid the raids of armies vying for Bellinzona, an important access route to the Alps. The beautiful housing cluster of Curz\u00fatt, with its stone buildings, gardens, and terraces planted with fields of grain and vineyards, has been beautifully restored by the Fondazione Curz\u00fatt-S. Barnard. The restoration was not intended to create an open-air museum, but rather a lively centre that now boasts a hostel and a top-level restaurant. Several buildings, stonewalls and the old mule path have been renovated with other on-site amenities including a delightful playground for children. After the visit of Curz\u00fatt the walk goes on descending to Monte Carasso, crossing through a hilly area carpeted with sun-drenched vineyards, and passing by the church of SS. Trinit\u00e0 and the curious cylindrical constructions named \"Fortini della fame\" (Hunger Towers). Another option is to descend by cable car from the intermediate station in Curz\u00fatt, but there is often a long waiting time. From spring to the end of October, there is a shuttle bus service with departure and arrival at the Infopoint in Monte Carasso. In the morning the bus takes you up to San Defendente's oratory: departure every 45 minutes between 9.15am and 0.45pm. In the afternoon, the shuttle bus bring you back to Monte Carasso: departure at the parking Pairolo under Curz\u00fatt. May and June, the shuttle bus is operating only Friday-Sunday and holidays; from July it operates daily, when the weather is good. Ticket office for both the shuttle bus and the cable car at the Infopoint in Monte Carasso. Info, timetables, prices: Infopoint Monte Carasso, via El Cunv\u00e9nt 3 - tel. +41 (0)58 203 14 50  -  carasc@bellinzona.ch For   lovers the hilly area, lying on the right bank of the Ticino River, offers some of the most interesting wineries in the Canton. A stroll through their vineyards is strongly recommended and represents a truly enjoyable experience! However, these vineyards are very difficult to handle. Not only are they steep and difficult to access but, in recent years, there have been recurring raids by wild boars. It has been estimated that looking after these vineyards requires almost twice the amount of time needed for those found in the valley. However, their favourable position contributes to the quality of the grapes grown here, which is truly excellent. Constant exposure to sunshine and fresh mountain air means that the grapes ripen to produce several excellent cultivars. At Curz\u00fatt\u2019s restaurant-hostel you can taste the wines produced on site from grapes cultivated in the old restored vineyard (with vines obtained from hybrids of different species) .  In the village of Monte Carasso, just a short walk from the cable car station, don\u2019t miss a visit to the three wine producers of note: \"Cantina Settemaggio\" (by the Marcionetti family), \"Cantina Pizzorin\" (by Giancarlo Pestoni) and \"Cantina I Fracc\" (managed by Christian Rigozzi, brother of the famous, former Miss Switzerland).  In Sementina, where this excursion begins, you can visit the cellars \"Colli di Sementina\" and \"Azienda Mond\u00f2\".\n                                ",

        "text": "Freiburger Voralpenweg, Stage 1/5 From the art and university city of Fribourg you follow the Galternschlucht (gorge) and a hilly route via St. Ursen (wooden storehouse) and Rechthalten (baroque church) to Plaffeien. Wonderful panorama of high plateaux and Jura. Freiburg ist eine zweisprachige mittelalterliche Universit\u00e4tsstadt mit elf historischen Brunnen, \u00fcber 200 gotischen Fassaden und viel Charme. Besonders eindr\u00fccklich ist die Kathedrale mit ihren wundersch\u00f6nen Glasfenstern und dem 74 Meter hohen Aussichtsturm. Sind die 365 Treppenstufen erklommen, bietet sich ein wunderbarer Blick \u00fcber die gesamte Stadt und die Freiburger Voralpen. Sie erstrecken sich in den Kantonen Freiburg, Bern und Waadt \u00fcber die deutsch-franz\u00f6sische Sprachgrenze. Die Landschaft ist mit ihren Gebirgen, Seen, Naturschutzgebieten und von Gletschern geschaffenen Urlandschaften vielf\u00e4ltig.  Die Etappe beginnt am Freiburger Bahnhof und f\u00fchrt zun\u00e4chst durch die engen Gassen der historischen Altstadt bis zur Kathedrale. Nach dem Abstieg zur Sense \u00fcberquert man die letzte gedeckte Holzbr\u00fccke der Stadt. Die Bernbr\u00fccke wurde bei einem Angriff der Berner 1340 zers\u00e4gt, um dem Feind den Weg abzuschneiden. Nun folgt der Aufstieg neben der Gott\u00e9ron-Schlucht und an Felsw\u00e4nden entlang hoch zum rechteckigen D\u00fcrrenbuhlturm. Am Turm vorbei gelangt man zwischen Wald und Siedlungsgebiet zur Kirche Notre Dame de Bourguillon. Der Ort ist beliebt bei Pilgern und war im Mittelalter Zufluchtsort f\u00fcr Menschen, die an Lepra erkrankt waren. Es folgt ein sch\u00f6ner Weg durch Weide- und Waldabschnitte in der h\u00fcgeligen Landschaft des Senselandes bis nach St. Ursen.  Die Wanderung f\u00fchrt weiter \u00fcber ein aussichtsreiches Plateau nach Rechthalten. Die hiesige Pfarrkirche St. German war nach einem Blitzeinschlag niedergebrannt und 1768 wieder eingeweiht worden. Bereits 1784 wurde ihr Holzschindeldach von einem Schuss getroffen, woraufhin die halbe Kirche erneut abbrannte. Zur Gemeinde geh\u00f6ren die Hochmoore Entemoos und Rotmoos. Aus den beiden Naturschutzgebieten wurde fr\u00fcher Torf gestochen. \u00dcber schmale Pfade und Treppen wird der h\u00f6chste Punkt der Route, das Buechench\u00e4ppeli erreicht. Auf Schotter- und Asphaltstrassen geht es weiter nach Plaffeien. Die sch\u00f6nen Alpen bleiben immer im Blickfeld. Kurz vor dem Etappenende wird die Grenze zum Naturpark Gantrisch erreicht, wo neben Naturerlebnissen auch die Biodiversit\u00e4t und die Dunkelheit gef\u00f6rdert werden. In Plaffeien angekommen, f\u00e4llt die gr\u00f6sste neuromanische Kirche des Kantons ins Auge. Der lebhafte Ort gilt als das wirtschaftliche Zentrum des Sense-Oberlandes.  Fribourg est une ville universitaire m\u00e9di\u00e9vale bilingue avec onze fontaines historiques, plus de 200 fa\u00e7ades gothiques et beaucoup de charme. La cath\u00e9drale avec ses magnifiques vitraux et sa tour de 74 m\u00e8tres de haut est particuli\u00e8rement impressionnante. Une fois les 365 marches gravies, vous aurez une superbe vue sur toute la ville et les Pr\u00e9alpes fribourgeoises. Celles-ci s\u2019\u00e9tendent sur les cantons de Fribourg, de Berne et de Vaud, \u00e0 travers la fronti\u00e8re linguistique franco-allemande. Le paysage est vari\u00e9 avec ses montagnes, ses lacs, ses r\u00e9serves naturelles et ses paysages primitifs cr\u00e9\u00e9s par les glaciers. L\u2019\u00e9tape commence \u00e0 la gare de Fribourg et m\u00e8ne d\u2019abord \u00e0 travers les ruelles \u00e9troites de la vieille ville historique jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la cath\u00e9drale. Apr\u00e8s la descente \u00e0 la Singine, on traverse le dernier pont en bois couvert de la ville. Le pont de Berne a \u00e9t\u00e9 sci\u00e9 lors d\u2019une attaque des Bernois en 1340 afin de couper la route \u00e0 l\u2019ennemi. On s\u2019attaque maintenant \u00e0 la mont\u00e9e \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des gorges du Gatt\u00e9ron et le long des parois rocheuses jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la Tour de D\u00fcrrenb\u00fchl, de forme rectangulaire. Apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 la tour, on rejoint entre la for\u00eat et la zone d\u2019habitation l\u2019\u00e9glise Notre-Dame de Bourguillon. L\u2019endroit est tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 des p\u00e8lerins et \u00e9tait au Moyen \u00c2ge un lieu de refuge pour les personnes atteintes de la l\u00e8pre. S\u2019ensuit un beau chemin \u00e0 travers des parties de for\u00eats et de p\u00e2turages dans le paysage vallon\u00e9e de la Singine jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Saint-Ours. La randonn\u00e9e se poursuit sur un plateau avec une belle vue sur Dirlaret. L\u2019\u00e9glise paroissiale locale de Saint-Germain avait br\u00fbl\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9e par la foudre, avant d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e0 nouveau consacr\u00e9e en 1768. Mais en 1784, son toit en bardeaux de bois fut touch\u00e9 par un coup de feu, ce qui entra\u00eena alors un nouvel incendie de la moiti\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9glise. Les hauts-marais de l\u2019Entemoos et du Rotmoos font partie de la commune. La tourbe \u00e9tait autrefois extraite de ces deux r\u00e9serves naturelles. En montant par des sentiers \u00e9troits et des escaliers, on atteint le point culminant de l\u2019itin\u00e9raire, le Buechench\u00e4ppeli. Puis la randonn\u00e9e se poursuit sur des chemins de terre et des routes goudronn\u00e9es jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Plaffeien avec les belles Alpes constamment en ligne de mire. Peu avant la fin de l\u2019\u00e9tape, on atteint la fronti\u00e8re du Parc naturel de Gantrisch, o\u00f9, en plus de la d\u00e9couverte de la nature, on promeut \u00e9galement la biodiversit\u00e9 et l\u2019obscurit\u00e9 naturelle. Arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 Plaffeien, le regard est attir\u00e9 par la plus grande \u00e9glise n\u00e9o-romane du canton. Cette localit\u00e9 anim\u00e9e est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme le centre \u00e9conomique de l\u2019Oberland singinois. Friburgo \u00e8 una citt\u00e0 universitaria medievale bilingue con undici fontane storiche, oltre 200 facciate gotiche e molto fascino. La cattedrale, con le sue bellissime vetrate e la torre panoramica alta 74 metri, \u00e8 particolarmente suggestiva. Una volta saliti i 365 scalini, si gode di una splendida vista su tutta la citt\u00e0 e sulle Prealpi friburghesi. Queste ultime si estendono oltre il confine linguistico tedesco-francese nei cantoni di Friburgo, Berna e Vaud. Il paesaggio \u00e8 variegato e presenta montagne, laghi, riserve naturali e paesaggi plasmati dai ghiacciai.  La tappa inizia alla stazione ferroviaria di Friburgo e si snoda dapprima attraverso le strette vie del centro storico fino alla cattedrale. Dopo la discesa verso il fiume Sense, si attraversa l'ultimo ponte di legno coperto della citt\u00e0. Il ponte di Berna fu fatto a pezzi durante un attacco dei bernesi nel 1340 per bloccare la strada al nemico. Segue ora la salita accanto alle gole del Gott\u00e9ron e lungo le pareti rocciose fino alla torre rettangolare di D\u00fcrrenbuhl. Superata la torre, procedendo tra il bosco e l'abitato, si raggiunge la chiesa di Notre Dame de Bourguillon. Questo luogo \u00e8 molto amato dai pellegrini e nel Medioevo era un rifugio per i malati di lebbra. Uno splendido sentiero attraversa i pascoli e le foreste della regione collinare di Sense fino a St. Ursen.  L'escursione prosegue su un altopiano panoramico fino a Rechthalten. La chiesa parrocchiale locale di St. German bruci\u00f2 dopo essere stata colpita da un fulmine e fu nuovamente consacrata nel 1768. Poco dopo, nel 1784, il suo tetto in scandole di legno fu colpito da un proiettile, dopodich\u00e9 mezza chiesa fu nuovamente bruciata. Le torbiere in quota di Entemoos e Rotmoos fanno parte di questo comune. Anticamente, da queste due riserve naturali si estraeva la torba. Seguendo stretti sentieri e scale si raggiunge il punto pi\u00f9 elevato del percorso, la cappella Buechench\u00e4ppeli. Si prosegue lungo strade sterrate e asfaltate fino a Plaffeien. Le splendide Alpi sono una costante di questo paesaggio. Poco prima della fine della tappa, si raggiunge il confine con il Parco naturale del Gantrisch, dove oltre alle esperienze naturalistiche si promuovono la biodiversit\u00e0 e il buio. Una volta giunti a Plaffeien, salta all'occhio la pi\u00f9 grande chiesa neoromanica del cantone. Questa vivace localit\u00e0 \u00e8 considerata il centro economico dell'altopiano della regione di Sense. Fribourg is a bilingual medieval university town with eleven historic fountains, over 200 Gothic facades and plenty of charm. The cathedral, with its beautiful glass windows and the 74-metre-high viewing tower, is awe-inspiring. Once you have climbed the 365 steps, lovely views over the entire city and the Fribourg Pre-Alps beckon. They stretch across the German-French language border in the cantons of Fribourg, Bern and Vaud. The countryside is stunning and diverse, with its mountains, lakes, nature reserves, and primaeval landscapes created by glaciers.  The stage begins at Fribourg railway station and initially leads through the narrow alleyways of the historic old town to the cathedral. After descending to the Sense, you cross the last covered wooden bridge in the city. The Bern Bridge was sawn up during an attack by the Bernese in 1340 to cut off the enemy's way. Now comes the ascent beside the Gott\u00e9ron gorge and along rock faces up to the rectangular D\u00fcrrenbuhl tower. Passing the tower, you reach the Notre Dame de Bourguillon church between the forest and settlement area. The place is popular with pilgrims and was a refuge for people suffering from leprosy in the Middle Ages. A beautiful path follows through pasture and forest sections in the hilly landscape of the Senseland to St. Ursen.  Over a plateau with superb views, the hike continues to Rechthalten. The local parish church of St. German burnt down after being struck by lightning and was consecrated again in 1768. As early as 1784, its wooden shingle roof was hit by a bullet, after which half the church burnt down again. The Entemoos and Rotmoos upland moors are part of the municipality. Peat used to be cut from the two nature reserves. The route's highest point, the Buechench\u00e4ppeli, is reached via narrow paths and stairs. Continue on gravel and asphalt roads to Plaffeien. The magnificent Alps are always in sight. Shortly before the end of the stage, you reach the border to the Gantrisch Nature Park, where biodiversity and darkness are promoted in addition to nature experiences. Arriving in Plaffeien, the largest neo-Romanesque church in the canton catches the eye. The lively town is considered the economic centre of the Sense Oberland.",

        "description": "From the art and university city of Fribourg you follow the Galternschlucht (gorge) and a hilly route via St. Ursen (wooden storehouse) and Rechthalten (baroque church) to Plaffeien. Wonderful panorama of high plateaux and Jura. Freiburg ist eine zweisprachige mittelalterliche Universit\u00e4tsstadt mit elf historischen Brunnen, \u00fcber 200 gotischen Fassaden und viel Charme. Besonders eindr\u00fccklich ist die Kathedrale mit ihren wundersch\u00f6nen Glasfenstern und dem 74 Meter hohen Aussichtsturm. Sind die 365 Treppenstufen erklommen, bietet sich ein wunderbarer Blick \u00fcber die gesamte Stadt und die Freiburger Voralpen. Sie erstrecken sich in den Kantonen Freiburg, Bern und Waadt \u00fcber die deutsch-franz\u00f6sische Sprachgrenze. Die Landschaft ist mit ihren Gebirgen, Seen, Naturschutzgebieten und von Gletschern geschaffenen Urlandschaften vielf\u00e4ltig.  Die Etappe beginnt am Freiburger Bahnhof und f\u00fchrt zun\u00e4chst durch die engen Gassen der historischen Altstadt bis zur Kathedrale. Nach dem Abstieg zur Sense \u00fcberquert man die letzte gedeckte Holzbr\u00fccke der Stadt. Die Bernbr\u00fccke wurde bei einem Angriff der Berner 1340 zers\u00e4gt, um dem Feind den Weg abzuschneiden. Nun folgt der Aufstieg neben der Gott\u00e9ron-Schlucht und an Felsw\u00e4nden entlang hoch zum rechteckigen D\u00fcrrenbuhlturm. Am Turm vorbei gelangt man zwischen Wald und Siedlungsgebiet zur Kirche Notre Dame de Bourguillon. Der Ort ist beliebt bei Pilgern und war im Mittelalter Zufluchtsort f\u00fcr Menschen, die an Lepra erkrankt waren. Es folgt ein sch\u00f6ner Weg durch Weide- und Waldabschnitte in der h\u00fcgeligen Landschaft des Senselandes bis nach St. Ursen.  Die Wanderung f\u00fchrt weiter \u00fcber ein aussichtsreiches Plateau nach Rechthalten. Die hiesige Pfarrkirche St. German war nach einem Blitzeinschlag niedergebrannt und 1768 wieder eingeweiht worden. Bereits 1784 wurde ihr Holzschindeldach von einem Schuss getroffen, woraufhin die halbe Kirche erneut abbrannte. Zur Gemeinde geh\u00f6ren die Hochmoore Entemoos und Rotmoos. Aus den beiden Naturschutzgebieten wurde fr\u00fcher Torf gestochen. \u00dcber schmale Pfade und Treppen wird der h\u00f6chste Punkt der Route, das Buechench\u00e4ppeli erreicht. Auf Schotter- und Asphaltstrassen geht es weiter nach Plaffeien. Die sch\u00f6nen Alpen bleiben immer im Blickfeld. Kurz vor dem Etappenende wird die Grenze zum Naturpark Gantrisch erreicht, wo neben Naturerlebnissen auch die Biodiversit\u00e4t und die Dunkelheit gef\u00f6rdert werden. In Plaffeien angekommen, f\u00e4llt die gr\u00f6sste neuromanische Kirche des Kantons ins Auge. Der lebhafte Ort gilt als das wirtschaftliche Zentrum des Sense-Oberlandes.  Fribourg est une ville universitaire m\u00e9di\u00e9vale bilingue avec onze fontaines historiques, plus de 200 fa\u00e7ades gothiques et beaucoup de charme. La cath\u00e9drale avec ses magnifiques vitraux et sa tour de 74 m\u00e8tres de haut est particuli\u00e8rement impressionnante. Une fois les 365 marches gravies, vous aurez une superbe vue sur toute la ville et les Pr\u00e9alpes fribourgeoises. Celles-ci s\u2019\u00e9tendent sur les cantons de Fribourg, de Berne et de Vaud, \u00e0 travers la fronti\u00e8re linguistique franco-allemande. Le paysage est vari\u00e9 avec ses montagnes, ses lacs, ses r\u00e9serves naturelles et ses paysages primitifs cr\u00e9\u00e9s par les glaciers. L\u2019\u00e9tape commence \u00e0 la gare de Fribourg et m\u00e8ne d\u2019abord \u00e0 travers les ruelles \u00e9troites de la vieille ville historique jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la cath\u00e9drale. Apr\u00e8s la descente \u00e0 la Singine, on traverse le dernier pont en bois couvert de la ville. Le pont de Berne a \u00e9t\u00e9 sci\u00e9 lors d\u2019une attaque des Bernois en 1340 afin de couper la route \u00e0 l\u2019ennemi. On s\u2019attaque maintenant \u00e0 la mont\u00e9e \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des gorges du Gatt\u00e9ron et le long des parois rocheuses jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la Tour de D\u00fcrrenb\u00fchl, de forme rectangulaire. Apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 la tour, on rejoint entre la for\u00eat et la zone d\u2019habitation l\u2019\u00e9glise Notre-Dame de Bourguillon. L\u2019endroit est tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 des p\u00e8lerins et \u00e9tait au Moyen \u00c2ge un lieu de refuge pour les personnes atteintes de la l\u00e8pre.
