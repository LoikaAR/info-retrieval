The panoramic views are unbeatable, extending from the Leventina region over the surrounding valleys and up into the Valais Alps to the west and the Graub\u00fcnden Alps to the east. This high-altitude hike runs almost exclusively along the ridge close to the Swiss-Italian border. The view from the summit of Monte Lema at the start of the hike is truly unforgettable. Lake Lugano sparkles far below on one side and Lake Maggiore on the other, both picturesquely nestled in the mountains of southern Ticino.    These picture-postcard views continue throughout this mountain hike, which includes only two major climbs: one up Monte Gradiccioli and the other up Monte Tamaro towards the end of the trail. For those who would rather avoid climbing these peaks, there are easy alternatives for bypassing both.    The Capanna Tamaro beneath the summit is a must, however. This hut is nestled close to the mountainside and offers up homemade specialities in addition to the views from the sunny terrace.

        "description": "The views here are unrivalled: This ridge walk from Monte Lema to Monte Tamaro is a classic amongst the Swiss high-altitude hikes. The panoramic views are unbeatable, extending from the Leventina region over the surrounding valleys and up into the Valais Alps to the west and the Graub\u00fcnden Alps to the east. This high-altitude hike runs almost exclusively along the ridge close to the Swiss-Italian border. The view from the summit of Monte Lema at the start of the hike is truly unforgettable. Lake Lugano sparkles far below on one side and Lake Maggiore on the other, both picturesquely nestled in the mountains of southern Ticino.    These picture-postcard views continue throughout this mountain hike, which includes only two major climbs: one up Monte Gradiccioli and the other up Monte Tamaro towards the end of the trail. For those who would rather avoid climbing these peaks, there are easy alternatives for bypassing both.    The Capanna Tamaro beneath the summit is a must, however. This hut is nestled close to the mountainside and offers up homemade specialities in addition to the views from the sunny terrace. From here it is only a stone\u2019s throw down to Alpe Foppa, a delight for culture aficionados with its Chiesa di Santa Maria degli Angeli, a church designed by Mario Botta.

On a trail with views of the Bernese and Central Swiss Alps, you can learn all about the local butterflies and their development. The cable car takes you comfortably up to Turren, where the hike begins. As you hike towards the valley, you'll enjoy views of the Bernese Alps and their glaciers as well as the Central Swiss peaks including Mount Titlis, the Stanserhorn, and Mounts Mythen, Rigi and Pilatus. Equally splendid: emerald-green Lake Lungern, a paradise for fishing enthusiasts.  The path is lined with an abundance of flora and fauna thanks to traditional and ecological cultivation by the mountain farmers. The hike passes through a plant conservation zone. Over 100 species of diurnal butterflies flit about on the dry grassland, including many rare and protected species. 17 information panels along the path describe the most striking types, with information about the butterflies, their development and distribution, and also about the plant world and the landscape structures. The largest numbers of butterflies can be observed between June and August.  Other rare insects and plants also feel very much at home on these sunlit slopes. Over 20 varieties of orchids and lilies can be found here between the end of May and mid-October. If you set out in the early morning hours, you'll have the best chances of spotting ibex, chamois, stags, roe deer or even eagles. On the last third of the hike, you're bound to encounter blocks of gneiss, also known technically as erratics or locally as \"Geissberger\". You will find them in Blattisdurren and the Sch\u00e4fschl\u00fcecht depression, where they were deposited during the retreat of the Aare glacier.

As you hike towards the valley, you'll enjoy views of the Bernese Alps and their glaciers as well as the Central Swiss peaks including Mount Titlis, the Stanserhorn, and Mounts Mythen, Rigi and Pilatus. Equally splendid: emerald-green Lake Lungern, a paradise for fishing enthusiasts.  The path is lined with an abundance of flora and fauna thanks to traditional and ecological cultivation by the mountain farmers. The hike passes through a plant conservation zone. Over 100 species of diurnal butterflies flit about on the dry grassland, including many rare and protected species. 17 information panels along the path describe the most striking types, with information about the butterflies, their development and distribution, and also about the plant world and the landscape structures. The largest numbers of butterflies can be observed between June and August.  Other rare insects and plants also feel very much at home on these sunlit slopes. Over 20 varieties of orchids and lilies can be found here between the end of May and mid-October. If you set out in the early morning hours, you'll have the best chances of spotting ibex, chamois, stags, roe deer or even eagles. On the last third of the hike, you're bound to encounter blocks of gneiss, also known technically as erratics or locally as \"Geissberger\". You will find them in Blattisdurren and the Sch\u00e4fschl\u00fcecht depression, where they were deposited during the retreat of the Aare glacier. Once you reach B\u00fcrglen, it's not far to Kaiserstuhl rail station, the destination of this unique hike."

The hike starts on Solalex plateau, located at the end of a valley basin at the foot of the Diablerets massif and the impressive Miroir d'Argentine: this shimmering silver rock wall, literally smooth as a mirror, is a classic for all mountaineers. It is actually a fossilised coral reef, once submerged in the primeval Tethys Sea (200 million years ago) \u2013 as plenty of fossils attest. This is one of Switzerland's most famous climbing walls, spanning multiple rope lengths. You then hike uphill towards Anzeinde on mostly broad paths. If you listen carefully, you'll hear the marmots whistling as you arrive. Farmed since the 13th century, this Alpine meadow is located on a broad high plain above the tree line. From here, you have a stunning view of the steep rock faces beneath the glaciated Diablerets group of mountains. Look up to admire the Alpine view \u2013 and from here on, the hike itself becomes increasingly Alpine. It takes you to Col des Essets pass, which you cross.    After descending through a valley to Alp La Vare, the route climbs again via Sur Champ to La Motte. You need to be sure-footed on this section, which is more challenging in a couple of places.

The path is relatively even, and in no time you arrive at the turnoff towards the Honeggerhorn. This is the highest point of the tour.

Conglomerate rock gorges in the Alpine foothills alternate with gentle hilly landscapes. The starting point for the hike is the Fischingen monastery, a gem among Switzerland's historical buildings. It is easy to get to using public transport. A restaurant and hotel business is run in the monastery, along with a carpenter's workshop. It is definitely worth a visit. Guided tours for groups are also offered. The hike is designed to make it possible to experience the characteristic features of the hilly landscapes of the Alpine foothills in the border region of the Thurgau, St Gallen and Zurich cantons. Shadowy sections of the diversely wooded area alternate with elevated paths that constantly reveal fresh views of Lake Constance and the Alps.

        "description": "This hike is representative of the hiking paradise in the Fischingen region. A steady ascent in shady woods leads upwards to splendid, far-reaching views. Conglomerate rock gorges in the Alpine foothills alternate with gentle hilly landscapes. The starting point for the hike is the Fischingen monastery, a gem among Switzerland's historical buildings. It is easy to get to using public transport. A restaurant and hotel business is run in the monastery, along with a carpenter's workshop. It is definitely worth a visit. Guided tours for groups are also offered. The hike is designed to make it possible to experience the characteristic features of the hilly landscapes of the Alpine foothills in the border region of the Thurgau, St Gallen and Zurich cantons. Shadowy sections of the diversely wooded area alternate with elevated paths that constantly reveal fresh views of Lake Constance and the Alps.

It offers breathtaking views over Lenk village and to the surrounding mountain world and leads past the most spectacular cascades in the Simmental. The hike starts with an ascent in the forest and continues along the Simmen falls to the first highlight: the Barbara bridge. From here, the stormy Simmen falls can not only be seen and heard, but also felt on one's own body in the form of water splashes. Here, masses of water cascade over the rocks and envelop the surroundings in mist. The bridge or dam in front of the waterfall serves as a barrier to divert the rising Simme. This measure was taken as early as the late 18th century to protect the valley from flooding. Barbara was the name of the wife of the Kurhaus director at the time, who made it possible to open up the Simmen falls and the barrage to tourists.  The route then winds its way up through the forest. Deep gorges can be observed, chiselled into the rock by the Simme. Before reaching Alp Rezlibergli, the terrain becomes somewhat more level, but the hike is all the more exhilarating as you detour to the seven springs of the Simme. At the foot of a mighty limestone wall, the Simme foams to the surface. In summer, up to 2800 litres per second flow from the seven springs. This fascinating natural spectacle and the surrounding mountain meadows with fireplaces invite you to linger.  The second ascent is another strenuous one. The highest point of the hike is reached at the historic Langermatte, where, according to legend, the \"women\u2019s battle\" was once fought. Today you\u2019ll find an alpine cheese dairy here; another follows on Alp Ritz. From Langermatte via alpine pastures, Iffigenalp is reached all too quickly.

Pany is situated on a sunny south-facing slope in the central part of the Pr\u00e4ttigau valley. The starting point of the hike is the car park next to the ski lift above the mountain village. Passing the famous panoramic swimming pool with a view of Klosters and the surrounding mountain world, the path continues on a moderate ascent. At Ruobsteinen you will see the legendary T\u00fcfelstein, the devil\u2019s rock. On its surface you find strange round depressions. Legend has it that these depressions represent the fossilized fingerprints of the devil. The path continues on a steady climb via Garongs, Lusi and Bova. Hiking through lush mountain meadows with rare flowers you reach the ridge and further on the Chr\u00fcz (2196 m above sea level), the highest point of the hike. Here you can enjoy some fantastic panoramic views and sign the summit book. The view extends over the whole Pr\u00e4ttigau valley to St. Ant\u00f6nien and the R\u00e4tikon region. Passing several small lakes, you then reach the Stelser lake via Gaf\u00e4ll. This is the only place in the whole of Graub\u00fcnden where the white water lily grows wild, and the highest. The lovely mountain lake is also known for its diversity of insects. Rare species of dragonfly such as the Mermaid or the Spear Azure Maiden can be observed here.

        "description": "Day-long hike over the alpine pastures of Valpun up to Chr\u00fcz. At the idyllic mountain lake you can admire the white water lilies and dragonflies. Another highlight: the 70-metre-long suspension bridge over the Gr\u00fcsttobel. You hike back to Pany via Tratza. Pany is situated on a sunny south-facing slope in the central part of the Pr\u00e4ttigau valley. The starting point of the hike is the car park next to the ski lift above the mountain village. Passing the famous panoramic swimming pool with a view of Klosters and the surrounding mountain world, the path continues on a moderate ascent. At Ruobsteinen you will see the legendary T\u00fcfelstein, the devil\u2019s rock. On its surface you find strange round depressions. Legend has it that these depressions represent the fossilized fingerprints of the devil. The path continues on a steady climb via Garongs, Lusi and Bova. Hiking through lush mountain meadows with rare flowers you reach the ridge and further on the Chr\u00fcz (2196 m above sea level), the highest point of the hike. Here you can enjoy some fantastic panoramic views and sign the summit book. The view extends over the whole Pr\u00e4ttigau valley to St. Ant\u00f6nien and the R\u00e4tikon region. Passing several small lakes, you then reach the Stelser lake via Gaf\u00e4ll. This is the only place in the whole of Graub\u00fcnden where the white water lily grows wild, and the highest. The lovely mountain lake is also known for its diversity of insects. Rare species of dragonfly such as the Mermaid or the Spear Azure Maiden can be observed here.

        "description": "The Nidwaldner H\u00f6henweg offers varied hiking on mountain trails with grandiose views. Two monastery villages invite you to visit. The many mountain cableway connections make it possible to split the five-day hike. The Nidwaldner H\u00f6henweg is a route around the Engelberg Valley at altitudes between 1600 and 2000m, with detours to Melchsee-Frutt and Niderbauen. The trail starts at the top of the Stanserhorn with marvellous views of the Alps and as many as ten lakes. From here the Trail leads around Canton Nidwalden along marked trails, in six one-day stages.  At the transition from Alpine foothills to Alps, the route offers grandiose views into the valley, of the encircling mountains and glaciated 4000m summits. You hike past alp meadows, rugged cliffs and tranquil mountain lakes as well as various passes and can delight in the impressive world of flora and fauna. Mountain guest houses and inns invite you to stay overnight or simply rest and refuel. In Engelberg and Niederrickenbach you can knock at the monastery gates and find friendly admittance.  The target of the Nidwaldner H\u00f6henweg is the summit station of the Niderbauen aerial cableway on the flank of the mountain of the same name. Each stage can be walked independently as every destination is located near a train or cable car station."

The hike through the spectacular alpine landscapes shaped by glaciers promises beautiful views of the dam with its lake, the wild Moiry valley at the end of the Val d'Anniviers, and the glittering Moiry glacier. This panoramic hike takes you around the turquoise-blue Moiry reservoir. If you\u2019re interested, you can learn more about electricity production on a guided tour inside the dam before or after the hike. A fascinating detail: thanks to a network of tunnels, the lake collects water not only from the Moiry valley, but also from neighbouring valleys. On the way down into the Rhone valley, you pass three hydroelectric power plants. The energy produced covers the electricity needs of more than 120,000 Swiss households. Start and finish of the circular hiking tour is the dam. From here, the steeply winding trail zigzags up the eastern slope above the lake to around 2,370 metres, after which the trail branches off to the south. First uphill, then alternatingly up and down, you reach the end of the lake and cross the alpine pastures of \"F\u00eata d'Ao\u00fbt de Ch\u00e2teaupr\u00e9\", before the trail descends steeply to the glacial waters of the Ch\u00e2teaupr\u00e9 lake. Here, the mountain stream Gougra is also crossed, which feeds the reservoir with the glacial water of the Moiry glacier. It is located about five kilometres south of the lake below the Pointe de Mourti. After crossing the river, the trail climbs again over the glacial moraine to just under 2,500 metres. Now you continue across the flank on the other side of the valley. Along the way, the small lakes \"Lac de la Bayenna\" and \"Lac du Louch\u00e9\" invite you to take a break before the final descent. Of course, the break can also wait until you get to the restaurant back at the dam, where a terrace with a lake view awaits.

        "text": "Oberdorf-Grenchen-Waldrandweg This leisurely hike from Oberdorf to Grenchen along the edge of the forest offers lovely views. One of the highlights is the Lommiswil quarry which is littered with dinosaur tracks. This pleasant hike leads mostly along the edge of the forest from Oberdorf to the watchmaking town of Grenchen. It is ideal for families as well as dinosaur fans. Apart from the pretty views, the dinosaur tracks near Lommiswil are a highlight of the tour. The tracks in the quarry were left by giant herbivores, or more precisely, by a group of brontosaurs. From the viewing platform you can see the tracks clearly, especially in oblique light. Information panels explain the history of their formation and provide interesting facts about the world of the dinosaurs, for instance, that the tracks are around 145 million years old. A visit to the Solothurn nature museum which features a topical exhibition is a good way to complement the experience.   After the quarry, you leave the forest above Lommiswil. The clustered village is situated on a terrace sloping slightly to the south, at the foot of the Hasenmatt, the highest Jura peak in the canton of Solothurn (1444 m.a.s.l.). From here, a level trail continues along the edge of the forest, interrupted only by two short forest passages across two streams. The stork village of Altreu, which at times is home to over 100 storks, is clearly visible during the hike. Tip: If you take the boat from Grenchen back to Solothurn after the hike, you will pass a place known throughout Europe where white storks were successfully reintroduced in 1948. Above Grenchen, the last two kilometres take you gently downhill towards the train station. If you still have time, you can visit the Grenchen boulder garden. Along a path of 500 metres, you get a glimpse of 500,000 years of the earth's history. Ten information panels and some 60 erratic blocks along the renaturalised Moosbach stream invite you to learn and linger. The Grenchen museum of culture and history tells the story of industrialisation and its consequences in the exhibition \"From farming village to industrial town\", using the region as an example. The exhibition focuses on the 1950s, the \"golden age\" of Grenchen's watchmaking industry.",

The remaining ascent of 450 metres in altitude proves to be increasingly challenging. Important: Follow the stony path of the white-red-white trail marking.

Easy first stage from Kiental to Kandersteg. Views down into the Kandertal, where the L\u00f6tschbergbahn trains roll through the landscape like a model railway. Gradual approach to the Alpine regions on the hike through the Gasteretal. This rugged high-Alpine valley is encircled by steep cliffs, the many arms of the meandering Kander seeking their way through a valley floor full of detritus and boulders. Lovely spots to discover at the water and a wealth of flora in spring.

        "description": "Four very varied days in the L\u00f6tschberg region. Sniff railway aromas high above the Kandertal, experience the rugged Gasteretal with all your senses. After crossing the L\u00f6tschengletscher (glacier), classic panoramic hike on the L\u00f6tschentaler H\u00f6henweg. The L\u00f6tschberg-Panoramaweg route is definitely diverse! From the Bernese Oberland into the Valais, a four-day tour menu to suit all tastes: a hike though a green, pre-Alpine region and the wild Gasteretal, crossing a glacier and climbing up into a world of smooth cliffs, finally looking into the middle of the Jungfrau-Aletsch-Bietschhorn UNESCO World Heritage. Easy first stage from Kiental to Kandersteg. Views down into the Kandertal, where the L\u00f6tschbergbahn trains roll through the landscape like a model railway. Gradual approach to the Alpine regions on the hike through the Gasteretal. This rugged high-Alpine valley is encircled by steep cliffs, the many arms of the meandering Kander seeking their way through a valley floor full of detritus and boulders. Lovely spots to discover at the water and a wealth of flora in spring. The king\u2019s stage is the longest section on the L\u00f6tschenpass, the history-steeped pass from the Bernese Oberland into the Valais. The first highlight is the L\u00f6tschengletscher (glacier) traverse with the stunning panorama of the Bietschhorn and Mischabel group no less impressive. The route continues through glacier-eroded terrain up to Lauchernalp to merge seamlessly with the popular L\u00f6tschentaler H\u00f6henweg. A true classic and a worthy finale to the L\u00f6tschberg-Panoramaweg."

At times, you hike across pastured woodlands, through the forest or past dry-stone walls \u2013 typical Jura scenery. From Chalet de la Dent de Vaulion, the eponymous peak (1,483 metres above sea level) is easily and quickly accessible. The slopes of Dent de Vaulion are mainly covered with pine forest. In contrast, the summit features the sparse grassy vegetation of the Haut-Jura. A marvellous vantage point offers panoramic views over up to eight lakes in good weather, including Lakes Neuch\u00e2tel, Biel, Murten and Geneva, three lakes in the valley and Lac de Rousses in neighbouring France.

The paths reflect various shades of green while the traditional dry stone walls blend harmoniously into the landscape. The pastures are dotted with stones of bizarre shapes. Since you are hiking in a nature reserve, dogs should be kept on a leash and you should not leave the paths.  A first highlight of the loop tour is the beautiful Creux du Croue, a 150-metre-deep basin with peat bog soil. Especially in autumn, the change of colours is lovely. The valley incision was probably formed first by erosion, then by constant washing out below the surface. A sheep pen sits in the middle.

This is where Aromat (a condiment) is manufactured. Another special feature: the commune has a longer border with Germany than with Switzerland. You follow the German border along the river Biber as far as Bibern. The \"Beauty of Bibern\" is not a lady, but a variety of plum. It is officially entered in the Swiss Register of Plant Varieties and is honoured with a festival every three years. A little gem in the local schoolhouse: the Museum of Typewriters, with over 400 models.

It is the starting point of many other hikes. Besides the sweeping views over more than 300 Alpine peaks, the east-facing, up to 200-metre-high cliffs are a sight to behold. Meanwhile, gentle slopes dominate on the westside. The Mont-d'Or mountain ridge forms the watershed between the catchment areas of the Rhine and Rhone. The same way leads downhill to Vallorbe, which keeps appearing in a different light."

Highlights of the summit circuit: the panoramic trip by chairlift to the starting point, the section over the Fenestral pass, the mountain lakes of Fully - and of course the view of the Mont Blanc and the Rhone valley. The Grand Chavalard (2899 m) is an impressive peak towering over the municipality of Fully in the Lower Valais. This hike circles it at an altitude of between 1850 and 2450 metres. The trail starts at the top station of the Jorasse chairlift, reached from Ovronnaz. After the panoramic ride, you climb up to the Petit Pr\u00e9 where the actual tour begins. From here on, you will cross some magnificent alpine landscapes. At first, there\u2019s a gentle uphill section to the pasture Grand Pr\u00e9 d'Euloi. During the snowmelt season, it turns into a lake.   Now it gets steeper: you have to climb more than 400 metres to the highest point of the tour. The view from the Fenestral pass (2453 m) is all the more spectacular: you look out over the lakes of Fully with the Mont Blanc massif in the background. Immediately after the pass, you reach the mountain hut Cabane du Fenestral. From the top of the pass, the trail first descends past the Lac Sup\u00e9rieur de Fully and the Cabane de Sorniot mountain hut (2,064 m.a.s.l.). The lake is a reservoir and stores the water from the hydroelectric power station near Fully. The power station was commissioned in 1915 - a pioneering achievement! Until 1934, the hydroelectric power station had the world's largest gross drop height of 1,643 metres. On the steep southern flanks of the Grand Chavalard, you have a view of the entire Rhone valley and Fully directly below. Did you know that one of the most exciting sporting events in the Valais takes place on these slopes? The \"Kilom\u00e8tre Vertical de Fully\" is a race run on an unused funicular railway line in which 1000 metres of altitude have to be conquered. With gradients of 60%, the race is considered one of the steepest and fastest in the world. The hike is much more leisurely.

Wakker Prize winner St-Prex on Lac L\u00e8man is well worth a stop. The town of Aubonne is situated on a ledge above the valley of the same name, at the edge of the Jura foothills, high above Lake Geneva, and it offers magnificent views. Patrician homes, narrow lanes, and a castle from the 11th century portray a picturesque, medieval town. Once you leave the charming little town, you are immediately in the vineyards of La C\u00f4te. This is the largest wine-growing area in the Vaud region, extending across 45 km, almost as far as Geneva. With its hills, rivers and the lakeshore, the region comprises a number of different soil types and great agricultural variety - ideal conditions for both white and red grapes. Here and in the entire Canton Vaud, the Chasselas is the predominant grape.  The hiking trail passes F\u00e9chy, Mont-sur-Rolle, Vinzel, and after almost four hours you are in Begnins. These names are all well known among wine connoisseurs. Out of twelve communities, a total of four have achieved Grand Cru status in an area of 1,900 hectares.  The first half of the long hike is now behind you and you leave the sun-exposed trails and vineyards. The scenery is changing.

        "description": "First along the lake shore then over meadows and fields, through airy forests, past vineyards and villages, castles and villas to the medieval town of Aubonne. Wakker Prize winner St-Prex on Lac L\u00e8man is well worth a stop. The town of Aubonne is situated on a ledge above the valley of the same name, at the edge of the Jura foothills, high above Lake Geneva, and it offers magnificent views. Patrician homes, narrow lanes, and a castle from the 11th century portray a picturesque, medieval town. Once you leave the charming little town, you are immediately in the vineyards of La C\u00f4te. This is the largest wine-growing area in the Vaud region, extending across 45 km, almost as far as Geneva. With its hills, rivers and the lakeshore, the region comprises a number of different soil types and great agricultural variety - ideal conditions for both white and red grapes. Here and in the entire Canton Vaud, the Chasselas is the predominant grape.  The hiking trail passes F\u00e9chy, Mont-sur-Rolle, Vinzel, and after almost four hours you are in Begnins. These names are all well known among wine connoisseurs. Out of twelve communities, a total of four have achieved Grand Cru status in an area of 1,900 hectares.  The first half of the long hike is now behind you and you leave the sun-exposed trails and vineyards. The scenery is changing. You walk downhill on the pleasantly shaded Toblerone path along the Serine river to the shores of Lake Geneva. By the way, the name of the Toblerone path has nothing to do with the famous triangular chocolate.

Today an alp area with typical timber houses in the middle of the R\u00e4tikonmassiv - an outdoor eldorado. Schweizertor: Alpine crossing to Brand (A), where the first Walsers settled in the 14th century. The Walser Trail follows the tracks of the Walser people in the high valleys of Graub\u00fcnden in 19 one-day stages, running along historical, pristine hiking trails. The approximately ten-hour hike begins in the Walser settlement of St. Ant\u00f6nien. It's the last stage of the long-distance hiking trail covering around 300 kilometres and 40,000 vertical metres. Past the pretty, late-Gothic church in St. Ant\u00f6nien, the trail leads slightly uphill on asphalt through the lush green hilly landscape. Partnun was settled by Walsers as early as the 14th century and inhabited all year round. Following the Schanielabach stream, you can see scattered huts and houses on the slopes to the left and to the right, the typical Walser settlements. After Partnun, the route continues up the valley on a narrow path. By the crystal-clear Partnunsee lake, large erratics invite you to do some climbing. The small lake is nestled between the limestone rock faces of the Sulzfluh and the Schijenflue.  At the foot of the imposing Sulzfluh, the trail continues uphill to the Carschina Hut, 2,236 metres above sea level. The views from the southern slope over the Pr\u00e4ttigau's peaks are breathtaking. Climbers, hikers and bikers meet at the hut, which has around 85 beds. Those who stay overnight can see the limestone cliffs of the R\u00e4tikon in a silvery light when the weather is clear and the moon shines.  Via a narrow path between steeply sloping meadows and scree, the route leads past the three towers of the Drusenfluh. To the south, they form vertical, up to 600-metre-high walls. At Chilchi, the Walserweg branches off to the right and separates from the Pr\u00e4ttigauer H\u00f6henweg (high-level trail). From here on to the Austrian border, concentration is required. Exposed, over an iron staircase, partly steep and secured with ropes \u2013 the path winds its way up to the Schweizertor. Massive rock formations rise vertically nearby. It's hard to imagine that there was once a customs hut here that was occupied all year round and can still be seen today.  Once in the Austrian Montafon, you hike on narrow footpaths through alpine meadows at the foot of the Kirchlispitzen. Via the Verajoch, you reach the end of the Brandnertal valley, where L\u00fcnersee lake lies. With an area of about 112 hectares, it was once the largest natural mountain lake in the Eastern Alps and is now one of the major reservoirs in Western Austria. It is suitable for fishing, and a walk around it affords fantastic views of the glaciers of the Brandner Valley. The lake, shimmering in brilliant turquoise in the sunshine, was voted Austria's most beautiful place in 2019. A long, narrow dam leads to the Douglas Hut, where you can spend the night. The hike to this point takes about seven and a half hours. It's not for nothing that the descent that now follows is called \"B\u00f6ser Tritt\" (wicked step). You can skip 400 metres in altitude difference by taking the cable car. The path has been cut into the rock, fixed with iron steps and secured with ropes. Along the Alvier, the route continues down the Seetal valley to the tree line. A beautiful forest path leads through coniferous woods.  The hike leads past the Kesselfall. Roaring and foaming, the Alvier flows through a narrow, 40-metre-deep rock gorge. The Kesselfall is easily accessible via footbridges, and a forest road continues to Brand. The long route ends in the tiny village with its pretty church, located in the valley basin at 1,050 metres above sea level.",

Another scenic highlight is the section in the Ti\u00e8che valley. The name of this hike says it all: you will be able to enjoy a magnificent panoramic view of the Rhone valley and the snow-capped four-thousand-metre peaks in the distance. On the opposite side: the Val d'Anniviers, majestically framed by five four-thousand-metre peaks with the Matterhorn as a highlight in the background. The starting point of the tour is the top station of the Cry d'Er cable car with a restaurant and a sunny panorama terrace.

Spectacular scenery and views deep into the valleys of Switzerland\u2019s founding canton as well as of the Zugersee and Vierwaldst\u00e4ttersee lakes. The Schwyzer Panoramaweg is characterized by the three history-steeped mountains; Rigi, Rossberg and Mythen: each with its own story to tell. Mainly railway history was written on the Rigi. The history of the Rossberg is tightly bound to the disastrous date of 2 September 1806, when a gigantic mass of rock crashed down into the valley from the slopes of the Gnipen, burying 457 people.

Spectacular scenery and views deep into the valleys of Switzerland\u2019s founding canton as well as of the Zugersee and Vierwaldst\u00e4ttersee lakes. The Schwyzer Panoramaweg is characterized by the three history-steeped mountains; Rigi, Rossberg and Mythen: each with its own story to tell. Mainly railway history was written on the Rigi. The history of the Rossberg is tightly bound to the disastrous date of 2 September 1806, when a gigantic mass of rock crashed down into the valley from the slopes of the Gnipen, burying 457 people. The history of the Mythen is also geological. The Mythen are actually all that remains of a layer of rock which has otherwise been completely eroded north of the Alps.

        "text": "Alpine Panorama Trail, Stage 14/29 Many paths lead to the Napf - but no roads! One of the most beautiful approaches to the summit is the scenic range of hills via Menzberg. The panorama of the Alpine chain, Mittelland and Jura from the Napf is one of the most magnificent in Switzerland. The high route between Napf and L\u00fcderenalp with the amazing views is one of the most beautiful and popular hikes in the Emmental Valley. Walking in peace, away from the noise of traffic and civilization, you feel the soothing effects of the lovely rolling landscape. Hiking across the trails, ridges and meadows of the Napf area is like traveling back in time. The trail passes solitary traditional farms and mountain inns where the farmers still serve you personally.  The highest part of this stage and the entire Napf region is the starting point: the peak of Napf Mountain with the hotel at 1406 m. The elevation of this area was formed millions of years ago by boulder deposits of the powerful original Aare into the former Molasse Sea of the Mittelland region. Even during the ice age, the area was not covered by ice. The characteristic topography of the Napf environment changed in conjunction with the ongoing effects of erosion. From Hotel Napf the pleasant high route leads down to Nieder\u00e4nzi and Hoch\u00e4nzi.  The trail steadily continues up and down. When the weather is clear, you always have a fantastic view of the Alps and the Mittelland region, all the way to the Jura Mountains. The well-known Oberlus Hut is located about half way through today\u2019s hike. It is a great place to take a break and enjoy the view of the snow-capped Wetterh\u00f6rner. You continue via Geissgratflue to L\u00fcderenalp, a popular destination with beautiful panoramic views of the Bernese Alps and the Jura Mountains. This is where you find the world\u2019s longest bench (38.03 m) made of one single tree trunk. Another highlight known far and wide is the \u201cL\u00fcderen Fest\u201d which takes place every year in early August.",

        "description": "Many paths lead to the Napf - but no roads! One of the most beautiful approaches to the summit is the scenic range of hills via Menzberg. The panorama of the Alpine chain, Mittelland and Jura from the Napf is one of the most magnificent in Switzerland. The high route between Napf and L\u00fcderenalp with the amazing views is one of the most beautiful and popular hikes in the Emmental Valley. Walking in peace, away from the noise of traffic and civilization, you feel the soothing effects of the lovely rolling landscape. Hiking across the trails, ridges and meadows of the Napf area is like traveling back in time. The trail passes solitary traditional farms and mountain inns where the farmers still serve you personally.  The highest part of this stage and the entire Napf region is the starting point: the peak of Napf Mountain with the hotel at 1406 m. The elevation of this area was formed millions of years ago by boulder deposits of the powerful original Aare into the former Molasse Sea of the Mittelland region. Even during the ice age, the area was not covered by ice. The characteristic topography of the Napf environment changed in conjunction with the ongoing effects of erosion. From Hotel Napf the pleasant high route leads down to Nieder\u00e4nzi and Hoch\u00e4nzi.  The trail steadily continues up and down. When the weather is clear, you always have a fantastic view of the Alps and the Mittelland region, all the way to the Jura Mountains. The well-known Oberlus Hut is located about half way through today\u2019s hike. It is a great place to take a break and enjoy the view of the snow-capped Wetterh\u00f6rner. You continue via Geissgratflue to L\u00fcderenalp, a popular destination with beautiful panoramic views of the Bernese Alps and the Jura Mountains. This is where you find the world\u2019s longest bench (38.03 m) made of one single tree trunk. Another highlight known far and wide is the \u201cL\u00fcderen Fest\u201d which takes place every year in early August."

Unter\u00e4geri is situated in a hilly moraine landscape on the shores of the blue \u00c4geri lake which is located on the course of the Lorze river and is considered one of the most scenic places in the canton of Zug. With the use of hydroelectric power in the 19th century, industrialisation began and the population increased accordingly.

The hike begins in the centre of the village. After crossing the Lorze, you leave the village and walk past a residential area, the sports field and old farmhouses. Until you reach the tennis courts, the road is mostly paved. This changes after the first hour of hiking: gravel roads, paths and forest roads now alternate until Brunegg. With the lake of Zug, the pretty hilly landscapes and countless cherry trees in front of you, you hike down the valley towards Zug. After the Ch\u00e4mistal forest, the Verena chapel catches your eye. This baroque chapel used to sit in solitude on the hill far above Zug. Today it is much less exposed due to the growth of the residential areas. Continuing through the new residential neighbourhoods, the Capuchin convent of Maria Opferung soon follows. In the 15th century, the Capuchins decided to make the education of girls their mission. Their commitment to education as well as the Franciscan monastic life lasted for many centuries to come. It was only in 2003 that the nuns had to discontinue the operation of Zug's first girls' school.

The hike from Betelberg down into the village of Lenk leads through an area of diverse vegetation, from the stony Gryden and agricultural alpine farms to the forests of the Wallbach gorge. The first 850 metres in altitude to the Leiterli top station are gained by means of the Betelberg cable car, where the unique high-altitude trail through the Gryden area starts in a leisurely manner. In view on the first section: the protected, alpine moor landscape of Halserberg/Betelberg. Before the mountain trail narrows and the first ascent begins, it is worth stopping for a break at the Steinstoss alp which you will pass again on the way back.  The following easy ascent runs along the south side of the St\u00fcbleni limestone formation, the highest point of the hike. On a clear day, you can enjoy a fantastic panoramic view: from the Simmental over the Saanenland to the mountain gems of Fribourg. The \"St\u00fcbleni\" (small rooms) refer to the individual \"craters\" in the Gryden area, whereby \"Gryde\" probably comes from Chride (chalk). But how did this unique area in Switzerland, which fascinates geologists, biologists and hikers alike, come into being? The rain gradually dissolves the almost white, relatively soft gypsum rock. The water carves holes in it, but continues to flow underground, creating a system of gypsum karst with cavities. When one of these collapses, the sinkholes become visible on the surface. In the St\u00fcbleni area, these seepage funnels are particularly numerous.  The trail winds downhill past the sinkholes towards the turning point of the circular hike. A detour to the refuge is worthwhile here: take a break and enjoy the moon-like crater landscape before heading back. Those who do this additional loop should be sure-footed and free from vertigo. This time you pass the \"St\u00fcbleni\" to the north. From there, the trail descends steadily to Steinstoss, after which there is only about one kilometre left to reach the starting point.",

Once you reach Airolo, the obere Leventina valley awaits with further discoveries. The historic stage to Airolo starts on the most important north-south trans-Alpine route, the language border between German- and Italian-speaking Switzerland and the wellspring of Europe. Even the Romans avoided the Gotthard route, not for the Alps' height, but for the Sch\u00f6llenen Gorge between Andermatt and G\u00f6schenen, which was reputed to be impassable. It all changed with the construction of the Devil's Bridge at the start of the 13th century. At the same time, the muleteer's trail was also improved over its entire length. The pass soon became one of the most important Alpine crossings. From the start, the route first follows the winding Tremola road for 100 metres. It's Switzerland's longest memorial to road construction. Hiking on a path, you will soon find yourself high above the world-famous serpentine road, which on its most spectacular section climbs 300 metres in altitude around 24 bends. To this day, the Tremola road has largely retained the appearance of its reconstruction completed in 1951 \u2013 with granite cobblestones, old drystone walls and the beautiful kilometre stones.

        "description": "The Champl\u00f6nch-Il Fuorn route is the ideal tour as an introduction to the Swiss National Park. Thanks to its interactive kids trail it is also ideal for families. The highlight is the cute marmots at Alp Grimmels. \u00abI\u2019ll show you what you can\u2019t see\u00bb is the motto of the Champl\u00f6nch Kids\u2019 Trail. Get to the root of the mysterious deer activity; eavesdrop on the conversation of mule-train traders of yesteryear; discover the truth about dwarfs and marmots \u2013 the kids and family offers at the National Park provide all this and much more. A booklet and GPS device can be hired at the National Park Centre at Zernez. The hike leads from the edge of the park at Ova Spins to Hotel II Fuorn on the Ofenpass road. The route follows the old mule track used before today\u2019s Ofenpass road was built. Champl\u00f6nch means \u00ablong field\u00bb \u2013 and it is on this that visitors make the gentle hike towards Hotel Il Fuorn. A detour to Alp Grimmels is definitely worthwhile \u2013 and not only because of the marmots. The former alp affords wonderful views of the Ofenpass area with its extensive mountain-pine forests and is an ideal spot to take a rest."

From time to time you meet the pass road but also repeatedly find quiet sections at Alpoglen or P\u00f6rterwald. S\u00f6renberg is located in the UNESCO Entlebuch Biosphere. Nowhere else in Switzerland can you find so many nationally protected moors in such a small area as here. On the approximately 400 square kilometres, you can immerse yourself in a mystical world: In addition to pristine moor landscapes, idyllic alpine meadows, small mountain lakes, karst formations, primeval mountain pines and deep ditches and gorges dating back to the Ice Age captivate the visitors. The hiking trail leads uphill away from the Lucerne resort of S\u00f6renberg. The view of the Brienzer Rothorn and the Schrattenfluh, one of the largest contiguous karst fields in Switzerland, is superb. The approximately 6 km long mountain range is clearly distinguishable from the lovely Emmental and the Napf area. The mostly vegetation-free cirques (channels) of the Schratten limestone have numerous, widely branching caves. The water seeps directly into the depths through the fissured surface. After almost an hour's hike, you leave the biosphere area and arrive at the Lochh\u00fctte, and shortly afterwards at the Glaubenbielen pass at 1565 m.a. s. l. The view is now complemented by the lake of Sarnen and the summit of the Titlis. Continuing uphill, after another hour you reach the highest point of the stage below the Alpoglerberg at approx. 1640 m.a.s.l.  Next follows the descent. The path dips into the forest, partly with a lovely view, as you leave Sandboden and the P\u00f6rter forest behind you. You continue to follow the Altibach stream until it joins the Laui river. From here it is not far to Giswil, where the hike ends after almost six hours. The village is located in the valley area of the lake of Sarnen, at the foot of the Br\u00fcnig and Glaubenbielen passes.

The highest point is the Wyssbodehorn with a magnificent view down towards the mountain pass and across to the Valais alps. Engiloch is situated halfway between the Simplon pass and Simplon village and is a popular starting point for hikes. At first on relatively even terrain, this tour leads past larches to the Chluismatta alpine hut. Here you can taste local products (by appointment). Then the ascent begins: following the left side of the Ritzibach, you climb up the slope to Wysse Bode (2113 m). From here you enjoy a beautiful view of the waterfall, which you are now walking towards.  The trail then leads through a steep slope to a rock ledge. This part is secured with a rope. Steps carved into the stone also help with the ascent. The rocky terrain is overcome on the left side of the waterfall via a ramp. Behind it, somewhat hidden in a scree hollow: the crystal-clear Sirwoltu lake, which is dammed by a mighty moraine. Situated between Galehorn and B\u00f6shorn, it invites you to take a break. Afterwards, concentration and stamina are once again required: the trail climbs uphill over a steep scree slope to the highest point of the tour. The strenuous ascent to the Wyssbodehorn (2,623 m), which should only be tackled when visibility is good, is rewarded: the view over the Simplon pass with the Monte Leone massif is unique. The Valais alps greet you to the north, the Ossola mountains to the south. From now on, it's all downhill: following the ridge, you first cross the hilltop at Galu. You will see the Rossbode glacier and behind it, the north side of the Fletschhorn. A steep zigzag path descends to the alpine huts on the Rossbodustafel.

Having arrived at the Hohen Kasten thanks to the cable car, scenic enjoyment can continue with a visit to the modern revolving restaurant - where you can replenish resources or simply catch a glimpse of the extensive 5000m\u00b2 alpine gardens with over 300 diverse species of Alpstein plants and herbs. The well prepared hiking path leads just below the ridge, and in some places actually along it, so there\u2019s no need to mention that hikers are rewarded with some amazing views down over the Rhine Valley, Vorarlberg and Liechtenstein. And on the other side of the ridge you get a view of the S\u00e4ntis, and Appenzellerland as well as the F\u00e4lensee lake; to where the path passes following the descent from the Saxerl\u00fccke. As an alternative to the steep and direct path to Br\u00fclisau, if time is not an issue, by the Berggasthaus Plattenb\u00f6deli you can opt for an almost flat path to the Berggasthaus Ruhesitz \u2013 from where you can enjoy a speedy descent down to Br\u00fclisau on a rented scooter."

The trail leads through well-preserved villages with traditional architecture and historical charm, accompanied by a wonderful view of the valley and the Mont Blanc massif. From the Val d'Entremont, a road leads over the Great St. Bernard pass into the Italian Aosta valley. The pass has been an important transit route for centuries. But the Valais valley is also home to a number of very well preserved historic villages and hamlets. This hike connects the most beautiful among them: Liddes, Chandonne, Commeire, La Rosi\u00e8re, Chamoille d'Orsi\u00e8res and La Douay. The oldest and most famous route through the valley is the Via Francigena, a historic pilgrimage route from Canterbury to Rome. This hike, on the other hand, takes you a little higher through sunny pastures, forests and sleepy mountain villages off the beaten track.  The starting point is Liddes with its 13th century church and an interesting little museum. Afterwards, you reach Chardonne, a peaceful hamlet at 1454 m altitude situated on a sunny terrace. All the villages along the route boast a rich architectural heritage in the form of traditional houses, chalets and barns. A prime example: the sustainable tourism project \"montagne alternative\" in Commeire, a so-called \"albergo diffuso\". Every fourth barn in the hamlet is part of the concept hotel. From the outside, you can\u2019t tell them apart from the rest of the barns and dwellings. The hamlet hides another, not immediately obvious surprise: an underground artillery fortification. Built in the early 1940s, it had room for almost 140 soldiers who would defend the valley. The complex can be visited and it is even possible to rent parts of it for events.  The next village, La Rosi\u00e8re, attracts pilgrims from all over the world: Maurice Tornay, a Catholic priest (1910-1949) grew up here. He was active in missions in China and Tibet and was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1993. His birthplace is open to the public. After the sleepy village of Chamoille, the route ends at the bottom of the valley in La Douay.",

In just a few minutes, the cable car (operating from June to October) takes you from the village of Rodi-Fiesso right up to the Tremorgio hut (1850 meters): a 900 metre ascent which allows you to save a lot of energy. On reaching the top, you will be offered a fabulous view of the lake whose waters have been used for nearly a century to produce electricity. In autumn 2012, the Carlo Danzi Foundation promoted and funded the construction of a trail that allows you to walk around the lake: an easy, 3-km hike along flat ground, which takes about 40 minutes. Local products and hot meals can be enjoyed at the hut during the summer. On the other hand the vast plain of Alpe Campolungo (2100 metres), crossed by a crystal-clear stream, can be reached in less than an hour\u2019s walk from the cable car arrival station. An idyllic place, rich in minerals, studied by many researchers. During summer, the meadows abound in lush vegetation, and flowering shrubs add a touch of colour to the landscape. Here you can admire gentians, anemones, rhododendrons, buttercups, columbines as well as many other flowering species. While climbing up to Lake Le\u00ect (\u201cLe\u00ect\u201d meaning \"small lakes\" in Leventina dialect), which can be reached in about 45 minutes, the pasture gives way to rock. The landscape changes appearance and is dominated by the magnificent Pizzo Prevat silhouetted against the sky. It is a much-loved summit often tackled by mountain climbers who test their skills on this demanding ascent. The Leit Hut is the perfect place to take a pit stop, enjoying simple dishes including polenta served with regional alpine cheeses. Hikers will have to walk for another 45 minutes along a fairly steep, rather challenging path, before coming upon another hidden treasure, namely Lake Varozzeira (2400 metres), boasting a beautiful, almost purple colour.  Overall, allow about two hours to get to Lake Le\u00ect from Tremorgio (just under three hours to Lake Varozzeira). Anyone wishing to try their hand at a more challenging hike, or stay in the area overnight, can take the three-and-a-half hour climb up to the Campo Tencia Hut (the first hut built in the Ticino Alps, it was opened in 1912) and the eponymous Pizzo Campo Tencia, which, standing at a height of 3701 metres, is the highest peak in the Ticino area (calculate around 3 hours from the hut) Inaugurated in the summer of 2016, the geo-tourism trail of Campolungo comprises two routes, a flatter one skirting Lake Tremorgio, and a more challenging one that leads to the Leit Hut.

Black buffalos are seen on the decent - the reason Schangnau is famous for its mozzarella. Eggiwil is located in the upper part of the Emmental valley. Typical Emmental inns characterise the village. The hiking trail follows the Emme for the first few minutes, then leaves the course of the river at Untere Brach. Climbing uphill on paths and a paved road, you reach Ober Steinboden after an ascent of 400 metres, followed by Hinder R\u00e4misgumme. The small farm is situated on the border of the Unesco Biosphere Entlebuch. The \"Wild West of Lucerne\" is known for its alpine pastures, untouched moorland, the wildly rugged Schrattenfluh or the Brienzer Rothorn, which is probably one of the most beautiful vantage points in Switzerland.  The Schrattenfluh, a mountain range of about six kilometres, is now located directly in front of you. On the other side you can see the extensive, mostly vegetation-free karst fields of the Schratten limestone. The numerous caves and furrows are the result of erosion processes, since the rain immediately seeps into the subsoil through the porous rock ledges. A short time later, you reach Pfyffer at 1316 m.a. s. l. From here and up to Wachthubel, the Napfbergland border trail uses the same route as the Trans Swiss Trail. Now the Hohgant, also known as the crown of the Emmental, emerges into view. After a gentle up and down hike, the highest point of the stage is reached an hour later at 1414 m.a. s. l.. The Wachthubel with its breathtaking panoramic view invites you to take a longer break.  Now follows the approximately one-hour descent to Schangnau, the destination of the hike. The village is located at the top of the Emmental on the border to the Bernese Oberland, surrounded by striking mountain ranges. The population is still widely involved in agriculture and dairy farming. The water buffalo are a speciality here. Their milk is very rich, containing about twice as much protein and fat as cow's milk, whereas the cholesterol content of buffalo meat is half that of beef. Both are consumed here without long transport routes.",

        "description": "Ridge walk on the west flank of the Pfyffer. Breathtaking views from the Wachthubel of Schrattenflue and Hohgant, foothill bastions of the Alps. Black buffalos are seen on the decent - the reason Schangnau is famous for its mozzarella. Eggiwil is located in the upper part of the Emmental valley. Typical Emmental inns characterise the village. The hiking trail follows the Emme for the first few minutes, then leaves the course of the river at Untere Brach. Climbing uphill on paths and a paved road, you reach Ober Steinboden after an ascent of 400 metres, followed by Hinder R\u00e4misgumme. The small farm is situated on the border of the Unesco Biosphere Entlebuch. The \"Wild West of Lucerne\" is known for its alpine pastures, untouched moorland, the wildly rugged Schrattenfluh or the Brienzer Rothorn, which is probably one of the most beautiful vantage points in Switzerland.  The Schrattenfluh, a mountain range of about six kilometres, is now located directly in front of you. On the other side you can see the extensive, mostly vegetation-free karst fields of the Schratten limestone. The numerous caves and furrows are the result of erosion processes, since the rain immediately seeps into the subsoil through the porous rock ledges. A short time later, you reach Pfyffer at 1316 m.a. s. l. From here and up to Wachthubel, the Napfbergland border trail uses the same route as the Trans Swiss Trail. Now the Hohgant, also known as the crown of the Emmental, emerges into view. After a gentle up and down hike, the highest point of the stage is reached an hour later at 1414 m.a. s. l.. The Wachthubel with its breathtaking panoramic view invites you to take a longer break.  Now follows the approximately one-hour descent to Schangnau, the destination of the hike. The village is located at the top of the Emmental on the border to the Bernese Oberland, surrounded by striking mountain ranges. The population is still widely involved in agriculture and dairy farming. The water buffalo are a speciality here. Their milk is very rich, containing about twice as much protein and fat as cow's milk, whereas the cholesterol content of buffalo meat is half that of beef. Both are consumed here without long transport routes."

The pristine, lovely Schwarzsee, changing colour from turquoise to black, depending on the light, is both start and destination. The Schwarzsee, nestled in the foothills of the Fribourg Alps, looks dark. Legend has it that the water appears almost black since a giant washed his feet in it.

Surrounded by a majestic backdrop, including Kaiseregg, Spitzflue and the spotlight of this hike, the Schwyberg Mountains, the trail starts at the Hostellerie stop. From there it follows the lakeshore to Schwarzsee Bad on a level course. The ascent across meadows and through a scattering of trees turns at the edge of a forest. Shortly thereafter Fuchses Schwyberg is reached, an open peak with amazing views across the Schwarzsee Valley and the Kaiseregg, Spitzflue, Mol\u00e9son and La Berra mountains. A relatively flat section follows before the trail descends slightly toward Alp Hapferen Schwyberg. On the ridge in the direction of Gross Schwyberg the peak of Kaiseregg reappears and the views open up.

        "text": "Sentier du Talent A beautiful hiking tour in the forest along the Talent River. It is particularly well suited for families and can be done any time of the year. It offers a wide variety of flora and fauna as well as impressive structures, such as Montheron Abbey, old mills and waterwheels. Echallens extends on both sides of the Talent River on a plateau of the central Gros de Vaud district. The area in the Vaud midlands is also known as the region\u2019s breadbasket. The \u201cMaison du Ble et du Pain\u201d in the centre of Echallens highlights the history of wheat and bread. The heart of the village also comprises some lovely mansions and patrician homes from the 17th to the 19th century. The walk starts on the other side of the train station, near the tennis courts, where it enters the forest. The trail continuously follows the river after which the hike has been named. The source of the Talent River, a tributary to the Orbe, is in the Bois du Jorat forest area. The Talent and the Orbe merge into the Thielle River which flows into Lake Neuch\u00e2tel. The upper and middle parts of the Talent are largely natural or near-natural, including in the Bois de la Commune forest where the trail leads to the Malapalud farming village. The kids will enjoy the wide variety of flora and fauna along the river, especially since native animals are often spotted here. The second part of this flat and easy hike runs through the Bois aux Allemandes via Cugy to Montheron. The distance of just under 10 km allows various side trips to nearby places of interest. Channels and waterwheels, for example, are found in Echallens, Assens, Bretigny and Cugy. Those in Echallens are now used for trout farming. In Assens, a restaurant is located next to an 18th century mill. Some of the buildings close to the route are also of interest, such as the Montheron Abbey, one of the last examples of Cistercian architecture in the Canton Vaud. The Moulin de Cugy is an old, completely renovated mill whose original condition was preserved. It houses a restaurant and an art gallery. Art is also the focus of the \u201cL\u2019Escpace Culturel Assens\u201d museum. All towns and villages along the route are easy to reach with public transportation and therefore ideal for a visit.",

Many aquatic animals can be discovered along the lakeside path, castle and winding old town to admire in Erlach. Situated at the western end of Lake Biel, the starting point of Erlach, with its picturesque alleys, squares, and castle, is one of the lovely villages along Lake Biel. The castle is now a boarding school for boys and girls. From Erlach, you can also explore St. Peter's Island, a peninsula that extends about five kilometres into Lake Biel. The area is a nature reserve that can only be explored on foot or by bike. The hiking trail, however, takes you in the other direction along the lakeshore through bushes and reeds, slightly ascending to Vinelz. After that comes the tour's only (modest) incline. You will have fantastic views of the entire lake, St. Peter's Island and the Jura from the ridge path. The area along the shore was inhabited as early as the Neolithic Age. After about 90 minutes, you reach L\u00fcscherz. From here, the trail leads again along the lakeshore to the mouth of the Hagneck canal below the village of the same name. The hydroelectric power station was built in 1899 and reopened in 2015. A nature reserve of national importance, the Auenwald, was created around the power station. The eight-kilometre Hagneck canal is also the centrepiece of the Jura water correction (1867 to 1891) and was a pioneering project for land reclamation. With an ingenious canal system, it was possible to lower the water levels of Lakes Murten, Neuch\u00e2tel and Biel. The land was protected from flooding, and the soil became available for agriculture. However, the draining also caused the disappearance of many animal and plant species that had previously been native to the marshland. The hike continues along the lakeshore until you reach the M\u00f6rigenbucht after about three hours. The hike's last hour then follows along the lake to the Nidau-B\u00fcren canal, which is already inside the urban belt. The city's dynamism starkly contrasts the previous tranquillity along the lake.

Culture, history, impressive mountains, canyons, old irrigation channels, a charming winegrowing region and natural landscape \u2013 explore all this by crossing the Raspille river and the German-French language border. The hike begins in the old Valais village of Inden, which can be reached by bus or on foot from Leuk or Leukerbad. Inden was an important place as far back as the late Middle Ages. The Romans used the route to get to the Alps\u2019 richest thermal springs in Leukerbad. In addition, due to the mule trail across the Gemmi Pass, the Dala Valley was one of the most significant trade routes between the Bernese Oberland and the Valais for centuries.  From the former train station the walk heads slightly downhill along the Dala-Raspille cultural trail and the track of the old Leuk-Leukerbad railway (1915-1967). An old lime kiln and turbines for a power plant are remnants from times gone by. From here the trail goes up moderately and continues directly along the vertical cliff. In 1779, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe described this trail as \u201cnot a dangerous, but a dreadful looking path\u201d. About 300 m of it are exposed, but the trail is wide, easy to hike and secured with steel cable where exposed. The view into the untamed Dala Valley and to the other side of the valley, however, is simply awesome. Once you arrive at the edge of the gorge (Schattufl\u00fce) the scenery changes. The views open up across the Pfyn-Finges nature park, the meandering Rhone and the lovely winegrowing area. Through the Varner forest, you reach the hamlet of Taschunieru and a short climb later you come to the entrance to the irrigation channel of Varen (Grossi Wasserleitu). Compared to the rather barren southern slopes the vegetation here is lush. Following the straight course of the irrigation channel, the trail crosses the landslide area on Varneralp. Near La Proprija you cross the German-French language border, defined by the Raspille river for which this hike is named.

The traffic-free, historic town centre and the Mediterranean-style squares and arcades give the town a southern flair. Numerous parks with magnolias and camellias, palm and olive trees invite you to enjoy the \"dolce far niente\", the sweet art of doing nothing. The lovely hike to Morcote begins in Lugano Paradiso.

Between vineyards and chestnut groves, this hike offers magnificent views of the Magadino Plain with Lago Maggiore in the background. The hikers are passing small villages before they get to Ponte Tibetano, one of the longest suspension bridges in Switzerland. It is definitely thrilling: with a length of 270 m it connects the two sides of the previously impassable Sementina valley. It does feel a bit unsteady 130 m above the creek, but there is no need to be afraid: the suspension bridge consists of solid larch wood planks and is held by metal wires. A hand-rail provides stability. Those without fear of heights will stop in the middle and enjoy the spectacular view of the Magadino Plain, Bellinzona and the surrounding mountains.  The next section of the route, always in the direction of Curz\u00fatt, takes us to a forest clearing with the Romanesque San Bernardo church from the 11th/12th century.

After just under two more hours, you reach your destination in Stans. The physically demanding, eight-hour hike ends on the village square. People settled in this beautiful spot as early as two hundred years before Jesus-Christ."

A peaceful hike through alluvial forest and along the riverbank, ending in the middle of the fortifications of Bellinzona. Biasca on the old Gotthard train line is also the southern portal of the Gotthard base tunnel, the new trans-alpine train link NEAT. Slightly above neighbouring Bodio the trains pass through the 57 km tunnel, which went into full operation in December 2016. It takes just a few minutes to get from the Biasca railway station to the embankment of the Ticino. Hiking along the river is almost effortless. Near Lodrino you change from one side of the river to the other. A huge stone quarry is visible from the path. The quarried granite walls tower high above the Ticino.  Most of the time you won\u2019t even hear the traffic of the motorway or the train track on the hiking path. After a little more than four hours you will spot a rocky outcrop above Claro. This is the convent Santa Maria Assunta. Surrounded by chestnut trees, it has been an extraordinary place of silence, prayer and work since its foundation. Inside, the nuns are dedicating their lives in almost total seclusion to their faith. They sell pieces of embroidery, homemade honey and biscuits and also restore books, all of which benefits the livelihood of their community. After Claro you walk along an industrial area for a while. Excavators, conveyor belts, and tipper trucks transport stone in and out of a gravel plant. A gigantic crane with six arms follows later. This is a gravity power plant. The idea seems trivial and ingenious at the same time: When the energy need is low, concrete blocks are lifted up by means of renewable energy, and when the energy need is high the process is reversed to generate additional energy, similar to the system of hydropower with a dam and a pumping station. A standard tower of 60 meters can store 35 MWh of energy and supply 5 MW to the power grid. That\u2019s enough for 2,000 households. About an hour later you reach Bellinzona.

Hiking along the mountain trail, you see evidence of land use indicating the farmers\u2019 struggle for survival a century ago. Lavertezzo is world-famous \u2013 not least thanks to social media \u2013 for its Ponte dei Salti, also known as the Roman Bridge. It leads in a double arch over the Verzasca. However, the stone bridge was only constructed after the Roman period in the Middle Ages and rebuilt in 1960 after its partial destruction. After crossing the famous bridge, the route continues through a beautiful forest, always close to the Verzasca. Ticino's Verzasca Valley is unspoilt and partly rugged, boasting many waterfalls and steep slopes. In summer, the crystal-clear and emerald-green water invites you to swim. At Ponte di Corippo, you leave the riverbank and climb up to the village. Corippo was included in the Federal Inventory of Protected Heritage Sites. Narrow alleys connect the stone houses in the village centre, and the centre of what was once the smallest village in Switzerland remains preserved today. A visit is certainly worthwhile. The ascent to Mergoscia, with views of the valley, comes next. The path between the villages of Corippo and Mergoscia was already mentioned in 1741 as a mule track. It's an impressive stretch with many vantage points \u2013 including the reservoir with the famous dam wall. This is where James Bond (or his stunt double) in the film GoldenEye plunged 220 metres using a bungee rope. Daredevils can emulate the secret agent and book a jump on the elastic rope. After Mergoscia comes the hike's second and more strenuous part to Sotto Cresta. Once you've made it to the top, you will be rewarded with breathtaking lake views. After a little over four hours of hiking, you deserve a break here. Next up is the 500-metre descent to Tendrasca, continuing along a seemingly endless high-level trail above Tenero, Minusio, Muralto and Locarno.

Highlights include three picturesque Alpine passes, mountain lakes and the Great St. Bernard with its hospice and the famous St. Bernard dogs. The Great St. Bernard has been an important link between northern and southern Europe since Roman times. In the Middle Ages, pilgrims crossed the pass on the way to Rome. Today, the Via Francigena offers hikers a historic tour from Canterbury to that city. The last part of the route described here, including three ascents to passes offering a wide variety of views, follows this historic route. The hike starts at the top of the pass. With the Grand Combin looming majestically to the east, the trail leads over the first pass, the Pas des Chevaux. It crosses the Torrent de Dr\u00f4ne river before winding its way in broad sweeps to reach a path leading to the next pass, the Col du Bastillon. Up here, an impressive panorama suddenly reveals itself, including the Grand Golliat, Mont Dolent, Mont Blanc and other peaks, with the unspoilt Val Ferret down below. The next destination on the hike is also visible by now: the three clear mountain lakes known as the Lacs de Fen\u00eatre, situated on a plateau about 2,500 metres above sea level and flanked by the peaks of the Mont Blanc massif. The carpet of cotton grass surrounding the lakes is a good place to rest and regain your strength for the next ascent to the Fen\u00eatre de Ferret, where the route crosses the border into Italy. This is an aptly named pass: it really does feel like looking through a window at the impressive 3,000 and 4,000-metre peaks, not to mention the historic hospice on the Great St. Bernard Pass. Back at the destination, hikers should allow plenty of time to explore the top of the pass. Highlights include the 11th century hospice, the baroque church and a small museum about the history and natural surroundings of the Great St. Bernard Pass. The undisputed stars of the show are the St. Bernard dogs, bred here by monks over many centuries. Whilst they are now reared in Martigny, the residents of the Fondation Barry still spend the summer on the pass, where visitors can take guided walks with them.",

The high-level hike over the Montagne du Droit links the windfarm on Montvel Crosin with the solar energy plant on Mont Soleil. Beautiful views to the Chasseral and into the French Jura region. The hike starts in Tramelan, which was closely associated with watchmaking up until the 1970s. Today, you can visit home workshops here. The windows of the temple church and the church of St. Michel also tempt you to explore. You leave Tramelan in a southerly direction. Passing the football pitch and following a straight path, you quickly reach the forest and the typical Jura landscape with its ancient trees and attractive flower-filled meadows. You see moss-covered stone walls as you proceed downwards on the northern hillside. Once on the wide, flat ridge of the hill, you look southwards across the Vallon de St. Imier with its magnificent view of the Chasseral. In contrast to the northern side, the southern hillside drops steeply and is densely forested. You pass a number of impressive windmills after Chalet-Neuf. They are part of Switzerland\u2019s largest wind farm, Mont Crosin, which produces electricity for about twenty thousand households. As the hike continues, you also go past the solar power plant on Mont Soleil. This was built in 1992 for research and demonstration purposes, and it was the largest photovoltaic solar power plant in Europe at the time. An adventure trail connects the energy plants. The path leads westwards across wide high Jura pastures and huge spruce trees. Various mountain farms and numerous drystone walls dividing the pastures blend superbly into the landscape. Depressions in the ground, known as dolines, offer shelter to animals such as foxes, wild boars, woodpeckers, lynxes and deer. They are formed through changes in the ground, which consists of rock that is easily penetrated by water \u2013 in this case limestone, and remarkable underground drainage systems with caves. Just before the village of Mont-Soleil, you come across another feature of this landscape: Champ Meusel, a circular hollow in the mountain with a diameter of about three hundred metres.

On the trail of the B\u00e4rgmandli, this hike circumnavigates the Giswilerstock, the mountain at the centre of Obwalden's mountain dwarf sagas. Legend has it that these figures with their pointy hats originally came from Venice. They knew the formula for making mirrors, which were costly items in the Middle Ages. The secret ingredient: rocks from the Alps such as brownstone, which contains manganese. Ore and mineral prospectors were soon excavating the region to find the sought-after deposits. This legends, the local geology, flora and fauna are described in the B\u00e4rgmandlipfad brochure (available at M\u00f6rli- and Fluonalp and at the Giswil tourist office). This circular hiking route begins at M\u00f6rlialp meadow, high above Lake Sarnen. Many parts of the path take you through a no-hunting zone where wild animals can rest. There you might observe chamois, deer and also the golden eagle. In springtime, the trail features a superb cross-section of alpine flora. Along the way you can have a hearty meal at one of the local restaurants. The trail provides wonderful views; to the south is Haslital with the Bernese Alps and the Wetterhorn chain beyond it; westward lies Mariental with the imposing Schrattenfluh; to the north are the Ried Alps bordering Mount Pilatus; and finally to the east is the lovely Sarneraatal.

On the heights of Mont-Soleil, above the valley of Saint-Imier and at the gateway to the Franches Montagnes, it offers magnificent views of the typical wooded pastures. The trail follows a part of the Sentier des Monts dedicated to renewable energies. Sonvilier is situated above the river Sch\u00fcss and extends into the upper Jura valley of Saint-Imier. Typical farms from the 17th and 18th centuries can be found in the village and on the nearby Jura hills. The hiking trail now climbs into these hills, first through some forest, then you reach the hotel and restaurant Chez l'Assesseur and the Buvette La Brigade. You then walk across fields with cattle and horses. The traditional form of mixed exploitation, where pastures and forest alternate like a mosaic, is typical of this region. The path also crosses an area where the milk for the famous semi-hard T\u00eate de Moine AOP cheese is produced. The Belvedere trail in the middle of the forest overlooks the valley of Saint-Imier and leads to the top station of the funicular connecting Saint-Imier with the Mont-Soleil. Here, the restaurant Le Manoir is a good place to stop for a break. The next section follows part of the Sentier des Monts theme trail which connects the Mont-Soleil solar power station with the Mont-Crosin wind power station. It offers games and information on the topics of renewable energy, the environment and climate. Here, a total of 16 wind turbines rise into the sky. When the wind sweeps over the heights, the turbines run at full speed. The observatory with its planetarium is also exciting. Guided tours can be booked in advance to visit the three facilities. Shortly afterwards, the highest point of the hike is reached at 1,290 metres altitude.  The descent to Saint-Imier via Le Sergent continues through the forest and passes near the mighty Champ-Meusel cirque. The almost circular depression is thought to be the result of a meteorite impact. With a diameter of 300 metres, it would be the largest remnant of a meteorite crater in Switzerland. It is also possible that the interaction of various forces led to this natural phenomenon, such as the tectonic position, glaciation, lime erosion and a spring with a stream. At various places you can enjoy the beautiful view over the valley of Saint-Imier, the Combe Gr\u00e8de nature reserve or the Chasseral with its famous 155-metre-high television antenna.

Descent face to face with the mighty walls of the Grand and Petit Muveran to Ovronnaz and a relaxing time in the thermal spa. Nestled beneath the Les Diablerets massif is the Derborence nature reserve. In 1714 and 1749, enormous masses of rock broke off and fell into the valley of Derborence, where they have since formed a 1.8-kilometre-wide barrier. This created Lac de Derborence and a pioneer forest of larches, mountain pines, birches and spruces. Some trees that survived the landslide are now over 600 years old. The nature reserve of national importance is home to one of the last primaeval mountain forests. At Lac de Derborence begins the long hike to Ovronnaz. You hike uphill into the rocky valley of the Dorbonne. There you follow the stream to Lac de la Forcle. On the way, you pass the Gite de l'alpage de Dorbon, a small mountain restaurant that invites you to take a break. After three and a half hours, you reach Lac de la Forcle. You get to a second small lake and the Glacier de la Forcle on the right lakeshore. Cross the small glacier on the right side before climbing the last 50 metres to Col de la Forcle. At the top, fantastic panoramic views of the Valais's 4000-metre peaks open up. From the Col de la Forcle, you first descend 150 metres, only to climb about a hundred metres again to just below the Cabane Rambert, a hut operated by the Swiss Alpine Club (SAC). The SAC hut offers a place to rest and can be used as an overnight stop to divide the long stage into two days. The views and the idyllic setting around the remote hut are fabulous.  From here, you have 1,200 metres to descend. After a few bends, you reach Plan Salentse, a small high plateau. Follow the stream of the Salentse, which rises slightly above, to the next small plateau at Plan Coupel. The route continues steeply downhill via Le Pessot, where the vegetation begins to change from Saille onwards. Depending on the season, the plain of Saille is dotted with wild flora, sometimes so tall that you can hardly see beyond the path.

The Alps don't stop at Switzerland's border. And not only that: the demarcation often cuts through regions that really belong together in topographical and cultural terms. One perfect example is the Drei Schwestern massif. If they were in the middle of Switzerland, they would certainly be as well known as the Mythen. Similar in rock structure, but the Drei Schwestern (three sisters) are more extensive and slightly more Alpine. Reason enough to pay your respects and head for them on the Liechtensteiner H\u00f6henweg. At first the route runs parallel to the F\u00fcrstin-Gina-Weg, which is not only interesting from a landscape point of view, but also in cultural terms. Or does Switzerland have a mountain-summit cross to compare with the one on Augstenberg, donated by an \u00abAssociation of Friends of Nativity\u00bb? Apart from this, various other chapels and religious symbols give a deep insight into the religious character of the Liechtenstein people, just as the stately residences do into their often well-filled wallets. And when even the forest paths on the Schellenberg are illuminated, things become really impressive. The classic high-level trail can be hiked in three one-day stages and offers fantastic views down to and across the Voralberg, the Rhine Valley and even to the Bodensee and summits of the Swiss Alps. The spectacular route leads along safe trails, over ridges, mountain slopes and finally the rocky crags of the Drei Schwestern, which according to legend, were formed by three sisters who preferred picking berries on a Sunday rather than going to church and were turned to stone.",

Reason enough to pay your respects and head for them on the Liechtensteiner H\u00f6henweg. At first the route runs parallel to the F\u00fcrstin-Gina-Weg, which is not only interesting from a landscape point of view, but also in cultural terms. Or does Switzerland have a mountain-summit cross to compare with the one on Augstenberg, donated by an \u00abAssociation of Friends of Nativity\u00bb? Apart from this, various other chapels and religious symbols give a deep insight into the religious character of the Liechtenstein people, just as the stately residences do into their often well-filled wallets. And when even the forest paths on the Schellenberg are illuminated, things become really impressive. The classic high-level trail can be hiked in three one-day stages and offers fantastic views down to and across the Voralberg, the Rhine Valley and even to the Bodensee and summits of the Swiss Alps. The spectacular route leads along safe trails, over ridges, mountain slopes and finally the rocky crags of the Drei Schwestern, which according to legend, were formed by three sisters who preferred picking berries on a Sunday rather than going to church and were turned to stone."

On the sunny side of the valley along the river Inn, you cross typical Engadine villages, pine and larch forests, crystal-clear streams and lush alpine meadows. The panorama: the gleaming glaciers of the Bernina group and the Engadine Dolomites in the Swiss National Park. The Via Engiadina is a long-distance hiking trail along the entire length of the Engadine. The twelve stages connect the village of Maloja in the Upper Engadine with Vinadi in the Lower Engadine on the border with Tyrol. In parts, the classic high-altitude trail runs through alpine terrain, then back down in the valley along the river Inn. A good level of fitness is a prerequisite for this 160-kilometre multiple day tour. But the fragrant stone pine forests, flowering mountain meadows, foaming torrents, picturesque Engadine villages and the impressive panorama quickly make you forget the occasionally tough ascents.  More than 800 glaciers feed the Inn which rises at the Maloja pass. The Via Engiadina also begins in Maloja. The village at the western end of lake Sils connects the Upper Engadine lake plateau with the valley of Bergell. Above the lake, the hamlet of Grevasalvas is worth a visit. Thanks to its picturesque location and rustic houses, it served as a Heidi film set in the 1970s. On the way past Silvaplana and St. Moritz, the gleaming glaciers of the nearby Bernina group are an impressive backdrop. The numerous cable cars in the area bear witness to the long history of the winter sports resort. Over several stages, the Via Engiadina offers wonderful views as well as insights into typical Upper Engadine villages, including Bever, S-chanf and Zuoz. Here you can admire stately patrician houses as well as traditional dwellings with bay windows and elaborately painted facades.  In the Punt Ota valley, the border into the Lower Engadine is crossed via the river of the same name. One of the most strenuous stages ends in Zernez, the gateway to the Swiss National Park. Along the river Inn, the hiking tour continues on a leisurely and relatively even path via Susch to Lavin. The next village is Guarda, home of the children's book hero Schellen-Ursli. The village is characterised by houses decorated with sgraffiti and flowers. Ardez, Sent or Tschlin are also worth a visit, and so are the valleys: Val Lavinuoz with a view of Piz Linard, Val Tuoi with its many contrasts, or Val Sinestra which has won awards on several occasions for its floral splendour.

The hike to the highest moor in Europe, situated on a sloping terrace above Meiringen, begins in Chaltenbrunnen. At first, the trail leads steeply up several hairpin bends to Chaltenbrunnenalp. Passing alpine pastures full of flowers, you then reach the plateau of the colourful high moor. An information board explains interesting facts about the nature reserve before you cross it. Because peat has never been extracted here, it is one of the most valuable moors of the Swiss aloes and can be experienced in its original form.  Countless little lakes and marsh ponds line the path together with high moor plants and loose clusters of small mountain pines. The centre of the moor is extensive and free of trees. The effort of the ascent is rewarded with an overwhelming view: the jagged peaks of the Garzen and the Wandelhorn tower up on the horizon along with the Engelh\u00f6rner on the other side. Equally unique: the Gyrensprung (1887 m. a.s.l.), whose shape is reminiscent of a ski jump to heaven. Once you have crossed Switzerland's best-preserved high moor, you reach the top of the Wandelalp. It is divided into three levels: the higher, middle and lower Wandelalp.  Good hiking boots are certainly recommended for a sure-footed descent via Iseltwald and Falcheren to the impressive Reichenbach waterfall. The sound volume of the 120-metre-high cascade gives only a hint of the force of the water as it crashes down. Author Conan Doyle was also taken with this natural spectacle, especially as he had his main characters Sherlock Holmes and his arch-enemy Professor Moriarty plunge down the waterfall in battle.",

Sornetan is about a hundred metres above the Sorne valley floor. Well-maintained farmhouses from the 18th and 19th centuries draw your attention here. The hike begins near the little 300-year-old church and proceeds westwards. After a short, flat section across a cattle pasture, the trail leads into the forest. The ascent now begins on the northern hillside of the Moron through a dense forest. You cross the steep slope on a surfaced path. At the top, you find yourself on wide Jura pastures with grazing horses. Beyond the village of Moron, the path runs downwards once more onto the plain. Just before Bellelay, you turn left onto the plains to the south. The town is famous for its impressive abbey, founded in 1136 and secularised in 1797. The property is now used as a psychiatric hospital. The monks of the abbey developed T\u00eate de Moine cheese in the 12th century, and its traditional production over a wood fire can be experienced in the on-site museum.

From Bielersee lake to the Aare banks and then a beautiful riverside hike to B\u00fcren. Over forested Bucheggberg and along the banks of the Emme to baroque Solothurn. German and French-speaking Switzerland meet at the Bielersee lake and the landscape also offers contrasts. On the southern shore, fens and secluded reed beds, on the northern shore, vineyards and the Jura chain with the often cloud-covered Chasseral. The Seeland-Solothurn-Weg begins in the small town of Erlach and over four days leads along not only the reed beds of the Bielersee southern shore, but also along banks of the Aare and Emme rivers. The changing atmosphere of lake and river are characteristic of the route. It\u2019s worth strolling to the castle in Erlach and through the narrow lanes of the old town quarter, or even making a detour to the St. Petersinsel, where writer Jean-Jacques Rousseau found refuge. With wonderful views of the opposite villages, the trail leads along the shore via L\u00fcscherz to Nidau and the bilingual town of Biel. The varied and attractive trail first stays close to the water, following the Nidau-B\u00fcren canal, marvel at the old course of the Aare and the striking wooden bridge at B\u00fcren. The observation tower in the H\u00e4ftli nature reserve at the gates of the medieval town will provide kids and adults with plenty of excitement. Historic Buchegg Castle is enthroned on forested Bucheggberg, and Landshut Castle with its moat stands on a rocky spur near B\u00e4tterkinden. You hike on the right and left bank of the Emme to where it flows into the Aare before reaching the history-laden baroque town of Solothurn at the end of the route.",

You then reach the centre of the world, where one part of the River Nozon flows to the Mediterranean, the other to the North Sea. Even after the fall of the Roman Empire, the Via Francigena remained one of the most important long-distance roads. Traders, soldiers and crowned heads used the route of approximately 1,700 kilometres, which runs from Canterbury to Rome. The stage described here starts on the plateau of Cossonay, above the Venoge river. Even in the High Middle Ages, the town was owned by an important noble family and was even granted a city charter in 1264. The urban landscape is characterised by the 19th century town hall with its classical fa\u00e7ade, the late Gothic Caf\u00e9 des Bains and other well-preserved town houses and patrician houses from the 17th to 19th centuries. From the plateau, the trail descends more than 100 metres in altitude to Cossonay Penthalaz. You continue hiking through the hilly landscape, forest and pasture sections. Finally, you walk along the banks of the Venoge to the scattered village of Vufflens-la-Ville. After that, around two and a half hours further along the road, comes Bussigny. After crossing under the motorway, there is an idyllic one-hour section that follows the Venoge river. The trail meanders along the river, which is partly still and partly fast-flowing, towards Lake Geneva. The trail branches off to the left at the estuary. You reach St. Sulpice along the shore of Lake Geneva, and one and a half hours sees the end of this stage at Lausanne Ouchy. This final part represents an extreme contrast to the first five hours of hiking: it goes from dreamy, secluded, natural and quiet to fast-paced, hectic, modern and noisy.",

The Matterhorn is reflected in three of the mountain lakes and the view of the towering peaks is awe-inspiring. The trail connects the Stellisee, Grindjisee, Gr\u00fcnsee, Moosjisee and Leisee lakes. The Sunnegga funicular takes just 4 minutes to get from Zermatt to the Sunnegga station at 2,288 m, followed by a 6-seater gondola ride to Blauherd.

The Fluhalp mountain restaurant is close by. The 5-Lakes Trail now continues gently downhill to Grindjisee, a highlight especially for botany buffs. The small lake offers a surprisingly rich moorland flora and rare flowers. The path then crosses over to the other side of the valley to Gr\u00fcnsee and leads through a former glacial area. With some luck, there will be some of the typical black-nosed sheep of the Valais around. Benches with a view of the Matterhorn are a temptation to linger and the views from the \u201cZe Seewjinu\u201d mountain lodge ranging from Matterhorn to Weisshorn are unparalleled. Next up is Moosjisee, a classic reservoir fed by glaciers and the reason why its colour is milky-white. The water is used to generate power and make man-made snow. The hiking trail then continues in the direction of the hamlet of Findeln, the dining hotspot of the Zermatt mountains, before the ascent to Leisee, the last of the lakes. Those who prefer to skip it can walk down to Zermatt in about 40 minutes. The Leisee is fun mostly for the kids who love to splash around in it. The Sunnegga station is just a short stroll from here, but there is always the Leisee-Shuttle to ride up to the station.",

The focal point of this hike is the impressive countryside and nature. Randen, the lime foothills of the Jura, stretch along the western part of the canton. Randen is known for its biodiversity. Many endangered or already extinct animals in the midlands can be found in large numbers on Randen. In spring you can see magnificent kinds of orchids. From May to June they display their beautiful colours. The Randen trail begins at the Schleitheim post office. The village nestles in the Schleitheim Valley, surrounded by districts of Randen and Staufenberg, where the path starts to climb. You follow the edge of the forest and cross Birbistel hill, heading for Beggingen. Along the way, you have views of the Wutach Valley, the Black Forest and the Klettgau Valley. Like all villages ending in \u00ab-ingen\u00bb also Beggingen illustrates the home of Alemannic roots. From Bekko we have Beckingen and later on Beggingen. From here, you climb over the Schwedenschanze, or Swedish Rampart: a name that recalls the incursion by a Swedish army during the Thirty Years' War (1618\u201348).  The ascent of the Schwedenschanze to the tower,Hagenturm, is rewarded with magnificent views of the Swiss Alpine panorama and the Black Forest. 225 steps take you up to the 40-meter high steel viewing platform, with panoramic information panels and seating at the top. Mount Hagen is the highest point in the canton of Schaffhausen. The way to Merishausen leads over Hagen and Berglen and through the valley, Gugertal, and along Schlothalde.

In Vicques, you'll appreciate the modern construction of the church with its stained glass windows. A visit to the Observatory and the Astronomy House is another  enjoyable and cultural aspect to discover. Back to hiking, a climb through the meadows will take you to the forest hut Pre Godat.

Selden is situated in the Gasteretal. It is the starting point of the physically demanding hike across the L\u00f6tschen Pass. First, you cross the Kander on a suspension bridge. The source of the river at Kanderfirn is located further up the mountain. The glacier, exposed to the west, starts near Tschingelhorn and Petersgrat. The latter is almost completely covered by ice.  At first, the path enters the forest and zigzags steeply uphill to Gfelalp, but mostly in the shade. Along the way you will pass three waterfalls on the Leitibach.  Leaving the tree line behind, you will reach a small alluvial plain of the Leitibach below Sch\u00f6nb\u00fchl. A fantastic view of the mountain chain opens up here, including Dolden-, Fr\u00fcnden-, Oeschinen- and Bl\u00fcmlisalphorn, all above 3300 m, and all the way to the Kanderfirn glacier. Continue uphill, across the pasture, and you soon get to Balme at the end of the L\u00f6tsche glacier. The hiking time up to this point takes at least 2.5 hours. You then traverse the end of the glacier across a scree slope and approach the glacier. The last steep section follows a short while later: a narrow path up the cliff, secured in part by steel cables. After about 15 minutes, you reach an altitude of 2689 m and there you are, on top of the L\u00f6tschen Pass.  The view of the prominent Bietschorn is spectacular.

Along the way you meet the old traditional wine villages of St-Saphorin, Rivaz and Epesses, and the lovely little towns of Cully and Lutry on Lac L\u00e9man. Lausanne is not only the capital of the Canton Vaud, it is also Switzerland\u2019s fourth largest city and since 1914 it has been home to the headquarters of the International Olympic Committee. The city is located on the southern part of the lake on a steeply rising hill. Lausanne\u2019s topography is impacted by the substratum which was shaped by the Rhone glacier in the ice age. In addition to the picturesque old town, the Olympic Museum and the impressive Notre Dame cathedral are other major attractions of the city. The three-hour hike to Morges begins on the shore of Lake Geneva. Lausanne Ouchy has some remarkable features to see: a generous boulevard, green park facilities, the expanse of the lake, and graceful mansions. After passing the harbour and the first park with athletic fields you soon cross the Chamberonne river. It forms the western border of the Lausanne district. Further along the lakeshore is the village of Saint-Sulpice. It is located about halfway between Lausanne and Morges. The residential community was established in the Middle Ages and also has a priory (a small convent) as well as a church from the 12th century, which is well worth a visit.

        "description": "A pleasant hike through the steep Lavaux vineyards, a UNESCO World Heritage since 2007. Along the way you meet the old traditional wine villages of St-Saphorin, Rivaz and Epesses, and the lovely little towns of Cully and Lutry on Lac L\u00e9man. Lausanne is not only the capital of the Canton Vaud, it is also Switzerland\u2019s fourth largest city and since 1914 it has been home to the headquarters of the International Olympic Committee. The city is located on the southern part of the lake on a steeply rising hill. Lausanne\u2019s topography is impacted by the substratum which was shaped by the Rhone glacier in the ice age. In addition to the picturesque old town, the Olympic Museum and the impressive Notre Dame cathedral are other major attractions of the city. The three-hour hike to Morges begins on the shore of Lake Geneva. Lausanne Ouchy has some remarkable features to see: a generous boulevard, green park facilities, the expanse of the lake, and graceful mansions. After passing the harbour and the first park with athletic fields you soon cross the Chamberonne river. It forms the western border of the Lausanne district. Further along the lakeshore is the village of Saint-Sulpice. It is located about halfway between Lausanne and Morges. The residential community was established in the Middle Ages and also has a priory (a small convent) as well as a church from the 12th century, which is well worth a visit. Following the lakeshore you cross the Venoge. This river is fed by three springs and until the early 21st century, many mills and sawmills were found along its shores.

It leads through the ancient larch forest of Balavaux. On the descent, the next scenic highlight follows: the Japanese garden. The hike starts at the top station of the Tracouet cable car. From there you continue for a short distance in the direction of the Tracouet lake, and then the path descends in hairpin bends to the Balavaux hut. Here you are surrounded by gigantic larches, some of which seem to come straight out of a fairytale. They are among the oldest in Europe. There are more than 250 of them around the alp, some are 1000 years old. One of the oldest larches has a circumference of 14.6 metres and is possibly the largest in Europe. After passing under the Prarion-Plan du Fou cable car, the path is now narrower and you step over roots and pebbles in increasingly alpine surroundings. As you reach the meadow, the mountain peak Pointe des Champs Ferret (2742 m) is visible. A scree field and a torrent are crossed. The ascent continues to the left of the Pointe des Champs Ferret. This section is short and steep. About halfway up, between stones and rocks, you can admire the view of Balavaux, the alps, and Tracouet. At a good 2575 metres, the ascent is completed and a magnificent panorama of the Mont-Fort and Mont-Gel\u00e9 mountains opens up, as well as down to the Cleuson dam and the Japanese garden. The descent begins on a steep and uneven path along a small stream. Crossing an alp, you reach a wide dirt track and an old moraine. To the right: the Japanese garden situated on the \"roof\" of a glacial moraine. Small trees and streams, moss-covered stones, lush green meadows: unlike in Japan, where the gardens with precisely these elements were usually created artificially, here on the plateau they are found in a natural setting.

Eight information panels provide details about geology, fauna, flora and the history of the Finhaut-Emosson region. The hike starts at the Mont Blanc Express in Finhaut and passes through the village. At the upper end of it, near Les Thi\u00e9s, a signpost points to \"A travers Finhaut\". Follow this route until you get to the Finhaut shooting range. Various biotopes are found in this area between swamps, hayfields and rocks. The landscape consists of small, boggy valleys, bordered by boulders \u2013 the result of glacial erosion. If you continue in the direction of T\u00eate de la Boffa, you will see odd foot and handprints on a rock on the right side, near a former sheep shed. These were left in 1927 by Louis Lugon-Moulin, nicknamed \"Louis of the Six Fingers\", a mail carrier between Finhaut and Vernayaz until about 1935. He died in 1969. Near T\u00eate de la Boffa (1426 m) the trail branches off to the left in the direction of F\u00e9nestral. It crosses a number of avalanche corridors with lush vegetation. Yellow gorse, heather, blueberries, Martagon lilies, bellflowers, fireweed and even raspberries are growing here, depending on the season. And then you arrive at F\u00e9nestral Alp at 1801 m, where the cows are summering until around mid-September. The alp is located in an old glacial cirque on a front moraine, indicating the significant forward push of the Bel Oiseau Glacier before it disappeared more than 10,000 years ago. The hike now continues to the dam of Emosson via the \"Col de la Gueulaz\" at 1965 m. This is where you have an awesome panoramic view of the Mont Blanc Massif and the Trient plateau, above the edge of the forest and in the midst of rhododendron, mountain pines and juniper bushes. The trail continues from the Emosson dam past the chapel and reaches the highest point of the Balcon du Mont Blanc trail at \"Six Jeur\" (2062 m) above Emosson, known for \u201cBas-marais\u201d, its exceptional protected biotope.",

        "description": "The trail leads from Finhaut to Six Jeur above Emosson and offers a fantastic view of the Mont Blanc Massif along the entire route. Eight information panels provide details about geology, fauna, flora and the history of the Finhaut-Emosson region. The hike starts at the Mont Blanc Express in Finhaut and passes through the village. At the upper end of it, near Les Thi\u00e9s, a signpost points to \"A travers Finhaut\". Follow this route until you get to the Finhaut shooting range. Various biotopes are found in this area between swamps, hayfields and rocks. The landscape consists of small, boggy valleys, bordered by boulders \u2013 the result of glacial erosion. If you continue in the direction of T\u00eate de la Boffa, you will see odd foot and handprints on a rock on the right side, near a former sheep shed. These were left in 1927 by Louis Lugon-Moulin, nicknamed \"Louis of the Six Fingers\", a mail carrier between Finhaut and Vernayaz until about 1935. He died in 1969. Near T\u00eate de la Boffa (1426 m) the trail branches off to the left in the direction of F\u00e9nestral. It crosses a number of avalanche corridors with lush vegetation. Yellow gorse, heather, blueberries, Martagon lilies, bellflowers, fireweed and even raspberries are growing here, depending on the season. And then you arrive at F\u00e9nestral Alp at 1801 m, where the cows are summering until around mid-September. The alp is located in an old glacial cirque on a front moraine, indicating the significant forward push of the Bel Oiseau Glacier before it disappeared more than 10,000 years ago. The hike now continues to the dam of Emosson via the \"Col de la Gueulaz\" at 1965 m. This is where you have an awesome panoramic view of the Mont Blanc Massif and the Trient plateau, above the edge of the forest and in the midst of rhododendron, mountain pines and juniper bushes. The trail continues from the Emosson dam past the chapel and reaches the highest point of the Balcon du Mont Blanc trail at \"Six Jeur\" (2062 m) above Emosson, known for \u201cBas-marais\u201d, its exceptional protected biotope."

However, hiking around Wasserfallen is also worthwhile all year round: in spring, wild garlic lines the paths, and the mountain air provides cool relief in summer.

The St. Meinrads Chapel on Etzelpass and the house where Paracelsus was born are popular resting places, not just for pilgrims. Einsiedeln is situated in the heart of central Switzerland in a pre-alpine high valley landscape. The route starts at the train station, but does not pass the famous monastery. Therefore, a detour to the impressive cathedral of Switzerland's most important pilgrimage site is definitely worthwhile. A first short passage leads from the station through a residential neighbourhood and past the hospital. Then, on the right-hand side, the huge ski jumping ramps catch your eye. The facility comprises 4 jumps, including the longest jump in Switzerland with a hill size of 117 metres. If you are lucky, you can watch international professional athletes during training. You then continue uphill over the Chatzenstrick and descend to Altmatt. Even from the heights of the Chatzenstrick you can see that the valley below is quite special. In autumn, the moor shimmers in brownish-red to golden colours. In the cool, humid climate of the plateau between Biberbrugg and Rothenthurm, high moors and shallow bogs have developed over thousands of years. When it rains, the peat mosses soak up the water like a sponge, and once the sun is back, they release the stored water into the environment. In this way, peatlands act as a natural flood protection. Since dead plant remains do not decompose due to the wet conditions, the carbon they contain is stored as peat for thousands of years and thus binds CO2. After passing the moor, there is a slight ascent up to the Raten. The splendid view over the Aegeri lake and the alps invites you to take a rest after almost three hours. The 7.2 square kilometre lake was originally formed by a glacier. The Battle of Morgarten between the Confederates and the Habsburgs took place on its shores in 1315.

Airolo is located in the Leventina district, which geographically comprises the valley of the Ticino river until Biasca, specifically the Val Bedretto and Valle Leventina valleys. The hike starts on the south side of the Gotthard Pass. Until Quinto you are mostly close to the motorway and able to gloat a bit when you look at the heavy traffic on the Gotthard route. Take the path to climb up to the rock outcrop with the remnants of Stalvedro castle, which probably dates back to the 13th century.  Back down again, follow the Ticino river to Piotta. The town is known primarily for its ice hockey club Ambri-Piotta. On the left side of the valley you will notice a funicular railway.

Later, the Roman Road led from Rodi along the western side of the valley to Monte Piottino and finally down to Prato. The \u201cUrner Saumweg\u201d (mule track of Uri) was not built until the 16th century and led directly through the gorge. This is when the Dazio Grande customs house was built, because the gorge formed the border between Swiss and Milanese territory. For a long time Rodi consisted of only this one building for the transfer of goods. At the same time, it also served as a toll station and customs office.

High above the valley, the Gommer H\u00f6henweg (high-altitude trail) leads through the fascinating and authentic natural and cultural landscape of the Goms region. Fragrant larch trees and wide flower-covered meadows are bordering the path through the young Rhone Valley. Some of these flowers are otherwise only found in botany books. The massive Weisshorn pyramid (4505 m) towers on the horizon with other 3000 and 4000 m peaks of the Valais forming the backdrop. Small villages and sleepy hamlets with their typical sun-darkened huts are visible down in the valley. The trail starts in Oberwald, the first village in the Goms region at the foot of Furka and Grimsel. This used to be an important Alpine trading centre. From the village the path rises through a meadow up to the edge of the forest. It crosses the track of the cog railway and enters the first larch forest. High above the valley it traverses the bridges over several mountain streams along the slope. After the Oberbach bridge it climbs a few meters up to the information board describing the panorama. Here at 1712 m is the highest point of the Gommer high-altitude trail. The chance to observe wildlife is particularly good in the forests protecting the villages in the valley against avalanches, falling rocks and landslides. Finally, a short downhill section to reach M\u00fcnster, the main town of the Goms region. With its intricate, typical Goms houses the village has gained national importance. The old larch-wood huts were built on stakes to protect them from gnawing rodents. Of course, the other villages in the Obergoms region are also worth a visit.

Humans and animals kept moving around, depending on the season, always in search of water. The loop trail explores the sophisticated antique irrigation system and ends with the emerald green waters of the Verzasca river. Thinking of Lavertezzo and the Verzasca Valley conjures up the arched stone bridge spanning the emerald green river. Images of natural swimming pools and an enticing dip arise. It\u2019s hard to believe that this valley once suffered a water shortage. But this is how it was. The old irrigation system with its catch basins, carved into the rocks, is what the easy loop hike along the Verzasca river is all about.  The trail starts near the church of Lavertezzo and climbs up to Sambugaro. Part of it follows the paths of the travelling farmers. These paths were used by semi-nomadic herdsmen to take the cattle to different summer pastures. The huts of Rev\u00f6ira, consisting of five settlement centres, and Ca d D\u00e9nt were inhabited in spring and fall. Some elements of the old irrigation system are seen here. Visible on the entire slope are 35 hollowed out, vat-like granite blocks holding about 4800 litres of rainwater. Six cisterns collected the groundwater to provide the \u201cblue gold\u201d to households and cattle.  Looking at the steep slopes above the pastures it is difficult to imagine how the grass was cut here. The hay was transported by hay bands. The points of impact can still be seen. The forest in the Verzasca Valley was used far into the 20th century for coal and timber production. When trees were cut, the slopes lost their hold. The forest where the path now leads had to be reforested to protect the road. Back down in the valley, the route continues to the Motta hamlet and shortly thereafter to a bridge crossing the Verzasca river. The path now turns and follows the right side of the river. Mostly in the forest it continues, sometimes over a flight of steps, to Lavertezzo. The crystal-clear, emerald torrent flows through the valley, roaring and foaming at times, quiet and serene at others. The double-arched Ponte dei Salti shortly before the destination is a popular photo spot. The natural bathtubs created by erosion are often used for swimming \u2013 a perfect end before the return to the village.",

The old irrigation system with its catch basins, carved into the rocks, is what the easy loop hike along the Verzasca river is all about.  The trail starts near the church of Lavertezzo and climbs up to Sambugaro. Part of it follows the paths of the travelling farmers. These paths were used by semi-nomadic herdsmen to take the cattle to different summer pastures. The huts of Rev\u00f6ira, consisting of five settlement centres, and Ca d D\u00e9nt were inhabited in spring and fall. Some elements of the old irrigation system are seen here. Visible on the entire slope are 35 hollowed out, vat-like granite blocks holding about 4800 litres of rainwater. Six cisterns collected the groundwater to provide the \u201cblue gold\u201d to households and cattle.  Looking at the steep slopes above the pastures it is difficult to imagine how the grass was cut here. The hay was transported by hay bands. The points of impact can still be seen. The forest in the Verzasca Valley was used far into the 20th century for coal and timber production. When trees were cut, the slopes lost their hold. The forest where the path now leads had to be reforested to protect the road. Back down in the valley, the route continues to the Motta hamlet and shortly thereafter to a bridge crossing the Verzasca river. The path now turns and follows the right side of the river. Mostly in the forest it continues, sometimes over a flight of steps, to Lavertezzo. The crystal-clear, emerald torrent flows through the valley, roaring and foaming at times, quiet and serene at others. The double-arched Ponte dei Salti shortly before the destination is a popular photo spot. The natural bathtubs created by erosion are often used for swimming \u2013 a perfect end before the return to the village."

Lovely moorland landscapes on the way through the Schlierental and across the Schlierengrat in the region of the Entlebuch biosphere reserve. The world\u2019s steepest cogwheel railway with a maximum gradient of 48% travels from Alpnachstad to the summit of Mt. Pilatus. Lucerne\u2019s very own mountain was once known as a source of treacherous storms and floods as well as the home of dragons and other monsters. It is said that the mountain took its name from Pontius Pilate, the governor of a Roman province at the time of Jesus Christ. Legend has it that he was buried in the lake at the mountain top. The route starts at Pilatus Kulm. It heads down to the valley and offers a magnificent view across the lakes of Central Switzerland, the city of Lucerne and countless mountain peaks. Within about a two-hour walk, it descends approximately 1000 meters in altitude, first on a steep path followed by a gravel road and surrounded by craggy mountain cliffs and blossoming meadows.  After L\u00fctholdsmatt the route goes gently uphill again. A broad gravel road leads to W\u00e4ngen where it briefly changes to a path. Taking a look behind you now and then, toward the start of today\u2019s tour and to Stanserhorn Mountain on the other side, is well worth it. After hiking more than four hours, an attractive two-hour section starts at Chr\u00fczliegg and continues to Schlierengrat, going gently up and down along the white-red-white trail markers. Through blueberry bushes, past gnarled pines and spruce, some of which have died off, you reach B\u00e4rnerstig, an old crossing to the Entlebuch region.   Next you pass through a fantastic moorland area leading to Schwendi Kaltbad, once a recognized health resort with a sanatorium. It was known for the healing power of its mud and sulphur baths. In the summer, Alpine church services and weddings are held in the small chapel. It doesn\u2019t take long to get to Langis from here, the end of this lovely, but sometimes strenuous hike.

Get to know the sly-witted Appenzeller humor and lose yourself in the fabulous landscape of Appenzeller Land with its breathtaking view of Lake Constance, extending as far as southern Germany, the Rhine Delta and the Bay of Bregenz.  On about 40 signposts you will find some of the funniest Appenzeller jokes. In the middle of the path on the Chistenpass is the \"Witzchist\u00e4\" during the summer season. Anyone entering this quaint wooden box is told jokes by born-and-bred Appenzell residents in a video message. The activities included in the backpack are carried out directly on the trail. The combination of hiking tour and adventure ride is considered a secret tip.

The sequence of historic routes, bridges, customs posts and hostels bring pre-modern transport to life. The historic hike to Andermatt starts in Wassen, famous for its \"Chileli\" (little church). Since the Gotthard Railway opening in 1882, it has been a landmark on the train ride south, during which you get to see the little Baroque church from three different angles. The stone and wood-built houses, along with the splendid fountain dominating the village square, are also a sight to behold. After two short sections along the motorway, the route leaves the road for good and continues slightly above the Reuss river. At Fusterblacken, you are directly above the motorway. A little further on, the path turns into a gravel road. The route continues along the railway line to G\u00f6schenen. Most people know G\u00f6schenen, located at the top of the Urner Reusstal valley, only from passing through it. The village was bustling between 1872 and 1882 and again almost a hundred years later, from 1970 to 1980. At the time, the world's longest railway tunnel and later the longest road tunnel were built. For this purpose, thousands of guest workers come to the village. Stretching to the west of G\u00f6schenen, away from the flow of traffic, lies the G\u00f6scheneralptal valley, a breathtakingly beautiful recreational area boasting reservoirs, moors, ponds and the 3,630-metre-high Dammastock.  The route now leads through the Sch\u00f6llenenschlucht (gorge) and, shortly after, across the beautiful, three-arch H\u00e4derlisbr\u00fccke (stone bridge). Your hike continues directly above the road, with the Reuss roaring ever more wildly through the valley. After the last bends, you can already see the monument to General Suvorov, who in 1799 successfully led Russian troops through the Sch\u00f6llenenschlucht despite resistance by the French. The famous Teufelsbr\u00fccke (Devil's Bridge) follows immediately after that. Around the year 1200, the people of Ursern \u2013 who knows, maybe even with help from the devil \u2013 achieved the unique feat of building a bridge across the gorge, which was previously considered impassable. In 1595, the wooden bridge was replaced by a stone structure. Note: The short 15-minute detour passing through the military shaft and above the Teufelsbr\u00fccke is worthwhile.

The Wildspitz, the highest mountain in Canton Zug, offers superb views of the lakes of Central Switzerland. The hike begins at Arth-Goldau station, a vital railway junction on the Gotthard line. The twin locality lies between Lake Zug and Lake Lauerz in the canton of Schwyz. A massive landslide formed an alluvial fan some 200 years ago. Today, this rocky, pristine, natural landscape is home to the renowned Goldau Wildlife Park.  You quickly leave the settlement area by heading north through the village centre along the main road. A steep ascent leads across flower meadows and past numerous cherry trees. In spring, the blooming hillsides provide a spectacular nature experience.  The trail turns into a forest path that leads steeply up to the Gnipen, following the ridge. The narrow path between forest and pastures offers breathtaking views, sometimes on both sides. Once you reach the summit, it becomes clear that you have been hiking next to the Goldau rockslide area.  Two hundred years ago, a massive forty million cubic metres of rock detached from the Gnipen and tumbled into the valley. Three villages were destroyed, and 457 people lost their lives. The natural disaster made headlines throughout Europe. A well-made, solid path continues along the ridge through the Bannwald forest up to the Wildspitz, the highest mountain in the canton of Zug and the stage's highest point, 1,570 metres above sea level. When the weather is clear, you can marvel at the S\u00e4ntis and the Churfirsten peaks from here.  On a narrower path, you now head downhill through cow pastures and small wooded areas. The Halsegg alpine inn invites you to take a last break before the descent to Sattel.

Information panels illustrate the history of the valley from Roman times to the present day. Along the way, you can visit the Vallorbe Iron and Railway Museum, the Le Day viaduct and the Saint-Maurice chapel. The theme trail between Vallorbe, Ballaigues and the French village of Jougne explores the geography, history and present time of the cross-border industrial valley of La Jougnena. It follows an inoperative railway line and a former pilgrimage route. Information panels along the way explain the history of the trade and transport routes since Roman times as well as the development of crafts and iron smelting. Further information documents are available from the tourism office in Vallorbe. Surrounded by lush greenery, Vallorbe nestles on the banks of the Orbe river. The hike starts at the train station which is surprisingly large for a village with less than 4000 inhabitants. This is due to its historical importance: Vallorbe is a railway junction and an important border station. In 1915, the Mont d'Or tunnel was opened here on the Paris-Dijon-Vallorbe-Lausanne-Simplon-Milan line. The trains cross the Orbe river on the impressive Le Day railway viaduct which you pass along the hiking trail. Some 450 metres downstream, the Orbe is dammed by the Barrage du Day. Crossing the dam wall, the trail then continues to Ballaigues.     A bit outside in the forest near Chez Barrat, you will discover a historical track (Roman road). In the middle of the 19th century, salt was transported from the French salt works to Bern and western Switzerland. After a short while you enter France on foot. The trail follows the river Jougnena which rises at the south-western end of the Aiguilles de Baulmes, flows into France and then back into Switzerland into the Orbe. Before arriving in Jougne, where you turn around, you pass the Saint-Maurice chapel. It is located on a former pilgrimage route between the abbey of Saint-Maurice in Valais and Burgundy. From Jougne, you follow a railway line that once connected Vallorbe at the foot of Mont d'Or and Dent de Vaulion with Pontarlier. Opened in 1875, it was damaged during the Second World War and gradually closed down.

Panoramic views of Valais Alps and Diableret glacier world. This tour's starting point is Gsteig near Gstaad in the upper Saane Valley. The stream that flows through the village is still the R\u00fcschbach, which joins the Saane immediately afterwards. At the beginning of the hike, you pass the old Hotel and Restaurant B\u00e4ren, an 18th-century house with a beautifully decorated fa\u00e7ade. You reach the Saane on a short, asphalted stretch in about 20 minutes and continue to the valley station of the Sanetsch cable car, which used to provide access to the power station. It takes you approximately 850 metres up to the Sanetsch reservoir, shortening the hike by about two and a half hours. Without the cable car, the old mule track quickly steepens and winds through the forest for the first 400 vertical metres. You cross the Saane several times, but unfortunately, you can only see very little of the Sanetsch Falls. Continuing along the path, you soon pass the tree line, and the view of the mountain peaks to the south becomes spectacular. Along the way, you encounter magnificently flowering plants, depending on the season. The mule track connected the Saanenland and the Rhone Valley as early as the Middle Ages. After crossing the cantonal border, the trail continues a few more metres uphill to the restaurant, where you can enjoy a drink and the views of the bright blue Sanetsch reservoir. The reservoir, built in 1963, can be circumnavigated on the approximately 1.3-kilometre-long route. After the break, follow a varied path along the left bank of the reservoir. Any slightly exposed parts are secured with chain railings. Continuing along the River Saane, \"La Sarine\" in French, you reach the Sanetsch Pass or Col de S\u00e9nin a little later. The Sanetschhorn catches the eye on the right. The mountain peak is the source of the 126-kilometre-long Saane. As you cross the pass, the Alpine panorama's scenery changes, and your gaze wanders to the high alpine peaks of Valais.

Biel/Bienne is not only a city where bilingualism is alive and well but also a watchmaking and industrial town. For instance, the Swatch watch company has its headquarters in Biel/Bienne with one of the world's largest timber structures, resembling a gigantic \"Tatzelwurm\". The second stage of the Seeland-Solothurn Trail starts at Biel/Bienne railway station and immediately passes Nidau Castle. The castle was a massive water fortress until late in the 19th century. After the Jura water correction, the water level dropped by around two metres. You cross the Nidau-B\u00fcren canal shortly after the castle at the Port ship lock. The hike now leads along the Aare, which is actually not the Aare itself but bears witness to the Jura water correction and is thus an entirely man-made part of the river, to B\u00fcren an der Aare. In those days, the Aare flowed in broad meanders from Aarberg towards Solothurn. The river's path at the time led to devastating floods, as the water could spread almost unhindered over the flat terrain of the Seeland. The Jura water correction took place between 1868 and 1891. The Aare was diverted into Lake Biel through the construction of the Aare-Hagneck Canal, the Broye and Zihl were straightened and deepened, and the Nidau-B\u00fcren Canal was dug. After about two hours along the canal, the trail crosses the bridge between Orpund and Scheuren. A few minutes later, you reach two hamlets in Meienried, where you cross the Alte Aare, once a mighty river, now just a stream at this point. On the opposite side of the Nidau-B\u00fcren canal lies the H\u00e4ftli nature reserve. Here the Alte Aare makes a semicircle in the direction of the Jura and borders a floodplain-like wetland. From the H\u00e4ftli observation tower, you have magnificent views over the nature reserve. The last hour of hiking takes you to B\u00fcren an der Aare. The beautiful, historic buildings are well worth a short detour into the small town or onto the massive wooden bridge, which was rebuilt after an arson attack in 1989 and inaugurated in 1991.

So characteristic of the Vall\u00e9e de Joux, cradle of many world-renowned luxury watches. Shortly after the start in Ballaigues, the route crosses the motorway and, a little later, the Lac du Day dam which stores water from the river Orbe. This river has its source in the Grotte de l\u2019Orbe, a stalactite and stalagmite cave that is one of Vallorbe's tourist attractions. The path takes you past Le Day Viaduct, a fine stone arch bridge dating from 1925. Walk along the shore of Lac du Day reservoir until you reach the Iron and Railway Museum. Since the Middle Ages, Vallorbe's deposits of iron ore and reserves of firewood have helped it to develop into a major centre of the iron industry.  Hemmed in between the Dent de Vaulion and the Mont d\u2019Or, the path leads to the venerable station building at Vallorbe. However, the size of this railway station is not due to the town's population: it was needed because the routes between Lausanne, Yverdon and France were historically important.

        "text": "Matterhorn Ascent On the day before the climb, one takes the cable car from Zermatt (1,620 m) to Schwarzsee (2,583 m). From there, one follows the hiking trail to the H\u00f6rnli Hut\u00a0Matterhorn (3,260 m). The climb to the hut takes about two hours. One should not arrive too early, since the hut is only ready for occupancy after 3 pm. After dinner, a discussion of the schedule plan for the next day takes place and the equipment is controlled. And then it is time to go to sleep. Because the hut warden wakes climbers at 4 am, and after breakfast, it is time to put on the climbing harness, hiking boots and helmet.  Climbers with mountain guides form a column and set off by foot first. In the dark, it is difficult to find the correct path; here, a mountain guide and a headlamp are necessary. It is very important to walk carefully on the loose gravel, because every misstep could start a rockslide for the following climbers.  The enjoyment of climbing on the H\u00f6rnligrat is a real pleasure for the mountain guides if one is fit enough to do so. The experience at the summit is unforgettable. Once one is at the top, there is a breath-taking panorama in every direction: Mont Blanc, the Grande Paradiso of the Bernese Alps and below the Liongrat towards Italy, the steep north face and the Mattertal. The climbers, who made the first ascent already used this route to conquer the Matterhorn in 1865. The H\u00f6rnligrat is primarily gneiss, which means that the danger of sliding and falling rocks is great. For this reason, it is important to engage a mountain guide for the climb.

        "description": "On the day before the climb, one takes the cable car from Zermatt (1,620 m) to Schwarzsee (2,583 m). From there, one follows the hiking trail to the H\u00f6rnli Hut\u00a0Matterhorn (3,260 m). The climb to the hut takes about two hours. One should not arrive too early, since the hut is only ready for occupancy after 3 pm. After dinner, a discussion of the schedule plan for the next day takes place and the equipment is controlled. And then it is time to go to sleep. Because the hut warden wakes climbers at 4 am, and after breakfast, it is time to put on the climbing harness, hiking boots and helmet.  Climbers with mountain guides form a column and set off by foot first. In the dark, it is difficult to find the correct path; here, a mountain guide and a headlamp are necessary. It is very important to walk carefully on the loose gravel, because every misstep could start a rockslide for the following climbers.  The enjoyment of climbing on the H\u00f6rnligrat is a real pleasure for the mountain guides if one is fit enough to do so. The experience at the summit is unforgettable. Once one is at the top, there is a breath-taking panorama in every direction: Mont Blanc, the Grande Paradiso of the Bernese Alps and below the Liongrat towards Italy, the steep north face and the Mattertal. The climbers, who made the first ascent already used this route to conquer the Matterhorn in 1865. The H\u00f6rnligrat is primarily gneiss, which means that the danger of sliding and falling rocks is great. For this reason, it is important to engage a mountain guide for the climb. If one is just one metre off the route, one is already subject to falling rocks or can cause that.

The following riverside hike along the Altrhein to Efringen-Kirchen is simply idyllic. The \u201cDreiland-Wanderweg\u201d (Three-Country Hiking Trail) is a cross-border route that connects Germany, France and Switzerland. This stage begins at the Schiffl\u00e4nde, the oldest port facility in Basel, which is now a landing stage for excursion boats and ships. The impressive Middle Bridge on the Rhine near the Schiffl\u00e4nde was built in 1905, replacing the former bridge from 1226. The first bridge was commissioned by Bishop Heinrich von Thun. In order to protect the bridge and ensure safe access to the episcopal lands in Breisgau, he had the then fortified Kleinbasel built on the right side of the river. From the 14th century, the bridge was part of an important north-south trade connection.  You reach Marktplatz not long after starting. This is dominated by the magnificent red sandstone town hall with its arcades, tower and inner courtyard, and is the seat of the government and parliament for the canton of Basel-Stadt. Passing Barf\u00fcsserplatz, it is worth taking a short detour to see the theatre and the Tinguely Fountain. In 1977, Jean Tinguely created a huge water basin with fun machine sculptures here, where the stage of the old city theatre once stood. We continue past Basel Zoo, or Zolli, as the zoo is called in Basel German dialect. Established in 1874, it was the first zoological garden in Switzerland. After passing the small hill of St. Margarethen, you leave the surfaced road and follow a gravel path that crosses fields until you reach the Bruderholz Cantonal Hospital. You enjoy a wonderful view of the city of Basel here. The route continues on surfaced roads. Then after a while you arrive on the banks of the Birs in M\u00fcnchenstein.

It starts just above the village of Gaflei, once the first health resort in the Principality of Liechtenstein. The sanatorium is long gone, but the view of the mountains of Eastern Switzerland from the sunny plateau is as dazzling as ever. Passing gnarled evergreens, meadows and bright green ferns and grass, the hiking trail melts into a dense forest and leads downward through some zigzags. At the ruins of Schalun castle, built in the late 12th century, you\u2019re at 860 m and half of the downhill elevation change is already behind you.  Continue further down the valley, on a wide gravel road now, to reach the castle of Vaduz in about an hour. Liechtenstein\u2019s landmark is perched on a rock terrace high above the capital. The roots of the castle are probably dated somewhere in the 12th century. It has served as the residence for Liechtenstein\u2019s first family since 1938. Through the lovely town and past the Rheinpark stadium you reach the border crossing on the Rhine. The old Rhine bridge (Alte Rheinbr\u00fccke) is 135 m long and connects Vaduz with the village of Sevelen in the Canton St. Gallen. It is the last surviving bridge across the Alpine Rhine. Out of 15 wooden bridges in the St.Gallen Rhine Valley, it is the only one that has withstood all floods and fires. On the next section to Sevelen the route follows the main road. Past the ruins of Procha castle and through the villages of Fontnas and Azmoos it takes roughly two more hours to get to Tr\u00fcbbach.  Beautiful forest roads and a path take you to the old iron ore mine of Gonzen. The mining resulted in a labyrinth of tunnels and galleries of just under 90 km. In the 15th century the ore was used by the old confederates to make the dreaded cut and thrust weapons. Some of the traffic noise can be heard even on the forest paths. Continue through well-tended residential neighbourhoods with views across the Rhine Valley and the Sargans region until you get to the Sargans castle a short while later. The structure was purchased by the community of Sargans in the late 19th century to save it from crumbling.

        "text": "Via Calanca At times typically alpine, at times almost Mediterranean: an unexpectedly diverse landscape awaits visitors to the Calanca Valley. While hiking through chestnut forests and hamlets, one can learn about the settlement history of the region, which has managed to preserve its originality. One of the most beautiful and unspoiled spots in all of Switzerland: the Calanca Valley. Its origin lies in the alpine mountain range of the Adula massif, in the heart of the Alps. Sculpted by the river Calancasca, this Grisons mountain valley opens to the south, revealing the vineyards of the Misox valley. The long-distance trail connects the villages of Grono and Rossa in three stages, revealing a wealth of scenic and cultural attractions along the way.    Passing by dry stone walls and chestnut forests, we reach the village of Castaneda. Traces dating to the Neolithic Period offer evidence that the region, heavily influenced by transit traffic over the San Bernardino Pass, was settled several thousand years ago. The ancient mule track now ascends to the village of Santa Maria. Dominated by the imposing Medieval tower and the parish church, it was once the religious center of the Calanca Valley. The sun-baked terraces upon which these two villages are situated testify to the intensive grain cultivation of yesteryear. Our journey now takes us towards Buseno/Molina, following a historic pathway which connects the Inner- with the Outer-Calanca Valley. Above us rises the spectacular rock-outcropping of Crap de Maria, at the base of which grow broom, hawthorn and juniper shrubs, underlining the arid landscape. Next, we pass the huge stone quarry, where gneiss is excavated to this day, arriving in Arvigo with its 16th century stone bridge. From here, it is worth taking a side trip to the picturesque, car-free village of Braggio, situated on a magnificent sun terrace high above. Braggio can be reached via the small self-service aerial cable car or on foot via the old mule path.

        "description": "At times typically alpine, at times almost Mediterranean: an unexpectedly diverse landscape awaits visitors to the Calanca Valley. While hiking through chestnut forests and hamlets, one can learn about the settlement history of the region, which has managed to preserve its originality. One of the most beautiful and unspoiled spots in all of Switzerland: the Calanca Valley. Its origin lies in the alpine mountain range of the Adula massif, in the heart of the Alps. Sculpted by the river Calancasca, this Grisons mountain valley opens to the south, revealing the vineyards of the Misox valley. The long-distance trail connects the villages of Grono and Rossa in three stages, revealing a wealth of scenic and cultural attractions along the way.    Passing by dry stone walls and chestnut forests, we reach the village of Castaneda. Traces dating to the Neolithic Period offer evidence that the region, heavily influenced by transit traffic over the San Bernardino Pass, was settled several thousand years ago. The ancient mule track now ascends to the village of Santa Maria. Dominated by the imposing Medieval tower and the parish church, it was once the religious center of the Calanca Valley. The sun-baked terraces upon which these two villages are situated testify to the intensive grain cultivation of yesteryear. Our journey now takes us towards Buseno/Molina, following a historic pathway which connects the Inner- with the Outer-Calanca Valley. Above us rises the spectacular rock-outcropping of Crap de Maria, at the base of which grow broom, hawthorn and juniper shrubs, underlining the arid landscape. Next, we pass the huge stone quarry, where gneiss is excavated to this day, arriving in Arvigo with its 16th century stone bridge. From here, it is worth taking a side trip to the picturesque, car-free village of Braggio, situated on a magnificent sun terrace high above. Braggio can be reached via the small self-service aerial cable car or on foot via the old mule path. Our itinerary takes us through the only flat plain of the Calanca valley, onwards to Selma, from where another detour via an antique footpath \u2013 or by means of another self-service cable car \u2013 leads us to the charming village of Landarenca at 1272m above sea level, on the right side of the Calancasca river.

        "description": "This tour isn\u2019t called a panoramic route for nothing. The entire route offers fascinating views of the striking Alpine terrain around Gstaad, including the R\u00fcebli, Gummfluh and Northern Alps massif. This hike starts at Zweisimmen, the eastern portal to the destination of Gstaad. From here there is a comfortable cable car ride up the Rinderberg. At over 2,000 metres above sea level, an amazing panorama of both the Simmental and Saanenland unfolds before your eyes. Follow the sign for Hornberg/Horneggli. The short ascent takes you over the Gandlouenen Ridge and onward to the Parwenge Alp. At the farm on the Parwenge Alp you can purchase products made on site, such as Alpine cheese and \u00abNidelt\u00e4feli\u00bb. On the way to the Hornberg there is a magnificent view of the pristine Turbachtal. And once you pass the Hornberg, the signposted Blumenweg trail goes left past the Hornfluh. On your way to the station for the Horneggli chairlift you encounter many fascinating names such as Gr\u00fcnstieliger Streifenfarn (Asplenium viride). It is a comfortable ride by chairlift to Sch\u00f6nried, and from here it is easy to catch the train back to Zweisimmen."

They are all beautiful, whether you decide to stop and admire them from their banks, immersed in silence, or whether you decide to view them from above.  Along the route you will be surrounded by Alpine flora and fauna and who knows, you might even happen to chance upon a few timid marmots. The trail takes around 5 hours without stops.

You can admire excellent glass works of art in the Notre-Dame de la Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t\u00e9 church and the Saint Germain collegiate church. The local precision engineering companies also have a national reputation. The first machine tools were built here and the industry still shapes Moutier today. The hike begins in the valley basin of the Birs. Part of the river flows directly along by the walls of the houses and forms a narrow alley through Moutier. You reach the end of the residential area across the Birs and briefly following the La Chali\u00e8re river. You then ascend on an attractive track at the eastern tip of the Moron. The ridge extends over a length of around 12 kilometres, going from east to west, and averages a width of 2 to 3 kilometres. You reach the broad ridge area through beech and fir forests. Drystone walls stretch in a dead straight line across the hills, and several mountain farms are to be found among the wide-ranging Jura pastures. By the time you reach the hamlet of Pr\u00e9s du Haut de la Charri\u00e8re, half the climb is done. A gravel road now takes you down a gentler incline to Moron Tower. The Ticino architect Mario Botta designed the 30-metre-high building. It was completed in 2004 with the help of around 700 apprentices. The construction was intended to promote the work of bricklayers and stonemasons. There is a spiral staircase with about 190 steps in the impressive tower, with each weighing 400 kg. You cover the final metres to the viewing platform on metal steps inside the tower. Once at the top, you enjoy a spectacular panorama of the Alps from S\u00e4ntis to Mont Blanc, and in the north from the Vosges to the Black Forest. The tower had to be closed temporarily (from summer 2023) when several of the steps broke off in 2022. You reach the highest point of the hike at 1,319 metres.

        "description": "This round trip follows for awhile on the five-star hiking trail and ends in the town Diemtigen which was awarded the Wakker-Price for its cultural constructions. Shortly after the departure from the Oey, Diemtigen train station, you start the ascent in the direction of the Tschuggen viewpoint. After a short warm-up phase along the edge of the forest, you reach Diemtigen. The Wakker-Prize was awarded to Diemtigen for excellence of building constructions. It will be worth a moment of your time to observe the craftsmanship invested in those buildings. Well-preserved houses reflect the art of carpentry of the past 300 years. The steepest and most strenuous section takes you through the Tschuggenwald forest until you finally arrive at the high plateau of the same name. Lush pastures offer the cattle pleasant summer months on the alpine slopes. Dairy cows are on the meadows and the cheese is produced right on the Alp. Once every year a traditional festival is held. Via Chilchflue and then mostly through the forest, the trail descends to Riedli and the bus stop. If you still feel like it, you can follow the valley waters of the Fildrich which joins the Chirel at Horboden. You continue between forest and river until the route ends back in the village of Oey in the foremost part of the Diemtigtal valley."

St. Moritz is located at 1865 m in the middle of the Upper Engadine\u2019s lake area. The world-famous resort originally owed its reputation to the mineral springs, which have been known for 3000 years. The town is the focal point of three cultural groups because of its proximity to Italy, the Romansh language and the predominantly German-speaking population.  This section of the route begins at the train station and leads directly along Lake St. Moritz to the wetland surrounding Lej da Staz. The small high moor lake is relatively shallow and because of its dark water, it is easily warmed by the sun. Its lovely beach makes it the premier swimming lake in the Engadine region.     A gravel path goes gently downhill through the beautiful Staz forest to Pontresina. The forest is part of the ecological Smaragd network that protects the habitats of endangered species of flora and fauna. Large parts of the forest are designated wildlife sanctuaries. After the forest, you follow the Rhaetian Railway to Pontresina. The mountain resort, surrounded by fragrant fir and larch forests, is located in the highest side valley of the Upper Engadine. An attractive path continues uphill through Val Bernina. Accompanied by the Ova da Bernina river and the Rhaetian Railway you continue hiking on beautiful forest paths along the slope to Morteratsch. After hiking about 3 \u00bd hours, you reach Cascada da Bernina where the mountain stream plunges almost 200 meters down into the valley. A waterfall path across wooden walkways and steps leads up to several waterfall platforms, offering views of the Bernina massif and its glaciers. The Rhaetian Railway meanders along this passage (without cogwheel) around tight turns and across historic viaducts.  Further along Ova da Bernina, attractive trails lead past boulders through the impressive mountain area to the Diavolezza gondola station. The gravel path through rocky grass landscapes takes you to Lej Pitschen, Lej Nair and Lago Bianco. Large Lago Bianco consisted of two natural lakes, which were joined by two gravity dams in 1911. Its name stems from the whitish colour that comes from the inflow of the Cambrena glacier. Both, the linguistic boundary between the Romansh-speaking Engadine and the Italian Valposchiavo, as well as the watershed are located at the height of the dam. From Lej Nair the water flows into the Black Sea, from Lago Bianco it makes its way to the Adriatic Sea.  The last section follows after you cross the dam, with views of the bare slopes of Piz Cambrena and Sassal Mason. Thin white-water streams and the Vadret dal Cambrena glacier are visible. The path continues above the train track leading to Ospizio Bernina at 2253 m. This very interesting, scenic and long section of the Via Albula/Bernina ends at the train station.",

Highlights: the Bernina pass with its lakes, the Diavolezza, the flowery Val Roseg, the culturally significant Engadine village of Sils together with views of the Bianco mountain ridge or the Upper Engadine lakes. An unparalleled scenery: this long-distance hike offers impressive views of all the glaciers in the Bernina massif. At 4049 metres, Piz Bernina is the only four-thousand-metre peak in the eastern alps and also the highest mountain in Graub\u00fcnden. On this tour it is circled as far as Maloja. As you start out on the southern side of the alps, you will experience a Mediterranean atmosphere against an alpine backdrop. From Poschiavo with its townscape of national importance, the first stage of the UNESCO world heritage route follows the Rhaetian railway. On the way to the Bernina pass at 2328 metres, you will see the Cavaglia glacier garden with its glacier mills and Alp Gr\u00fcm, offering a first view of the eastern side of the Bernina massif. The pass itself not only represents the main European water divide between the Black Sea and the Adriatic, but also the border between the Rhaeto-Romanic and Italian language zones.   At the Bernina hospice, a breather on the even, wide path along Lago Bianco helps to loosen the muscles. This is necessary, because the second stage climbs all the way up to the Diavolezza top station with spectacular views of Piz Pal\u00fc and Piz Bernina with the legendary Bianco ridge. You can take the mountain railway down to the valley or the trail past the Lej da Diavolezza. Once down, a steep ascent begins on the other side of the Val Bernina towards Fuorcla Pischa at 2835 metres. A jewel right at the start of the third stage: the Val da Fain, known for its magnificent alpine flora and the multitude of marmots. The area around Piz Albris is home to one of the largest ibex colonies in the alps. You descend through the Val Languard to Pontresina, the destination of this stage, either on foot or from Alp Languard by chairlift. After leaving the mountain resort, the trail takes you into the lovely Val Roseg. It branches off in front of the Hotel Restaurant Roseg Gletscher, and you find yourself surrounded by stone pines, larches and alpine flowers with a great view of the Sella and Roseg glaciers. Once you reach Fuorcla Surlej, you can see the lake Lej da Vadret and the Bianco ridge of Piz Bernina to your left. After Fuorcla Surlej, the wide path ends at the middle station Murt\u00e8l of the Corvatsch cable car. The last section is a downhill traverse along the mountain flank to Alp Pras\u00fcra. In the valley between the lakes of Silvaplana and Sils, you arrive at the culturally significant village of Sils with the well-known district of Sils Maria. Past the church of Sils Baselgia and now on the Via Engiadina, the route leads through Grevasalvas on the left side of the valley, where a Heidi film was shot in the 1970s.

Today\u2019s stage begins by leading out of Le Pont on the same trail on which the previous stage ended. After a little more than half an hour, the trail heads off to the south and the ascent to the roof of the Swiss Jura begins. Towering at 1,679 m above sea level, Mont Tendre is a highlight of the Jura hike for more than just its size. The view across the whole of Lake Geneva towards Mont Blanc and the Alps all the way to Vosges is one of the most glorious on the whole of the Jura Crest Trail. With this sight in view, the descent to the Col du Marchairuz pass begins. The pass that connects Lac de Joux with the wine-growing regions of Lake Geneva. Far below, Nyon, the destination of the Jura Crest Trail, can already be spotted. Almost close enough to touch. In addition to the beautiful restaurant and hotel, you also have another surprise in store upon arrival at the Col du Marchairuz pass: a direct view of Mont Blanc between the trees."

It is on the third leg, from the Walser village of Spl\u00fcgen to Isola in Italy, where you'll find the most beautiful historic remains of trails. History is experienced at every turn \u2013 as long as 2000 years ago the Via Spluga was the main link between the Grisons and Italy. People, goods and ideas found their way from Thusis over the Spl\u00fcgen Pass to Chiavenna and back.

        "description": "A cultural and long-distance hiking trail through exceptionally charming landscape. This trail is 65km long and runs from Thusis through the Viamala Gorge, the Roffla Gorge and on stone paths over Spl\u00fcgen Pass to Chiavenna. It is on the third leg, from the Walser village of Spl\u00fcgen to Isola in Italy, where you'll find the most beautiful historic remains of trails. History is experienced at every turn \u2013 as long as 2000 years ago the Via Spluga was the main link between the Grisons and Italy. People, goods and ideas found their way from Thusis over the Spl\u00fcgen Pass to Chiavenna and back. It is thought that in the early 19th century up to 2000 mules hauled goods from Munich to Milan over the adventurous Via Spluga every month.    If you want to follow the Spl\u00fcgen stretch all the way, it is best to leave your back unencumbered - if you so wish, your luggage can be transported to the next stopover on the route.    From Spl\u00fcgen, the route leads up the mountain \u2013 following some sections of the historic track \u2013 with particularly impressive scenery near the top of the pass. After crossing the pass and with the descent to Monte Spluga Lake behind us, another highlight of the tour awaits: the breathtaking Cardinello Gorge. The wildest part of the trail, it had to be wrested from the rock and leads adventurously down to the picturesque village of Valle San Giacomo, where it ends up at the little hamlet of Isola."

The impressive panoramas feature Mont Blanc, the Dents du Midi and the white peaks of the Valaisian and Vaud Alps.\u00a0    The circular trek follows well-marked mountain trails, mainly above the treeline, over six passes and past three mountain lakes. You can stop off for refreshments or stay the night at numerous huts along the route. The trek is not technically difficult. There is one section that is slippery when it\u2019s raining, but a detour is possible. This means that the trek is accessible throughout the hiking season. Hikers must be fit enough to walk for six hours per day. As the trek crosses several conservation areas, dogs must be kept on a leash on practically the entire tour.\u00a0    There are two access points, which you can reach by car or public transport: Derborence and Pont de Nant. You could also opt to start the trek with the last stage.\u00a0   \n"

Three-day panoramic hike with stunning views of the icy 4000-m mountains of Saastal and Mattertal. \u00abYou stand at the end of the world and at the same time at its origin, at its beginning and at its centre. A phenomenal silver setting, of a complete semi-circle, to the south snow-capped summits arranged in inexplicable harmony, to the west a chain of Gothic cathedral towers. At first you can only look up at them in awe, it\u2019s breathtaking\u00bb. No one describes the Saas-Fee Alpine backdrop as impressively as German author Carl Zuckmayer, who spent his last years in the glacier village. Thirteen 4000-metre peaks standing as guards of honour; can there be a more striking start to the \u00abSwiss Tour Monte Rosa\u00bb? This is a sensational panoramic tour, starting on the first day with the Balfrin high-level trail. It links Saas-Fee with Gr\u00e4chen and is a real challenge even for fit mountain hikers. The trail then leads from Gr\u00e4chen to Zermatt with spectacular views. Sections secured by ropes, waterfalls and bridges provide the trail with the necessary spice \u2013 and that with views of mighty 4000-m mountains including the \u00abMountain of Mountains\u00bb, the Matterhorn. The Swiss Tour Monte Rosa is identical to the \u00abKing\u2019s Stage\u00bb of the classical Tour Monte Rosa (TMR), an eight-day trekking tour around the Monte Rosa massif."

There are many opportunities for refreshments, swimming and water sports near the route. First stage on a circular trail, starting in the forest with a fairly steep climb. Culinary delights in Botterens with its goat's cheese, then a sweet break at the Maison Cailler in Broc. The legendary Mol\u00e9son is not far off. Return in the direction of Corbi\u00e8res along a quiet footpath. Second stage rich in history: Vuippens the manor house with its castle and gardens, Ogoz Island with its medieval ruins. At the water's edge hikers can swim, enjoy water sports or indulge in culinary delights, before heading to Rossens across the top of the cliffs that jut out over the lake. From Rossens, cross the 320 metres of dam between the lake and the chasm. Care is required when rejoining the footpath leading to Pont-la-Ville.

The tour begins at Grimmialp and leads along Senggibach creek, which leisurely flows through pastures and lovely meadows. The scattered farms are soon behind you and at W\u00fcrzi you enter the forest. On shaded, pleasantly cool forest trails you continue up to Alp Grimmi. When you get to the mountain restaurant of the same name, you\u2019re probably ready for a break. If you\u2019re lucky you might even catch a glimpse of some chamois balancing between the steep grass slopes on the mountainside. Shortly thereafter you approach the mystical place of Grimmiwasser. While the water of the mineral spring is colourless, the iron dissolved in the water settles on the underground and provides a rusty red colour. Long ago, the Alpine herdsmen of the Diemtigtal Valley told their neighbours from the Simmental Valley about the healing powers of the Red Spring located all the way in the back of the Diemtigtal. The healing spring water was known far beyond the small mountain valley. For particularly serious illnesses, the water was picked up in barrels, jugs and bottles at the alp, even in winter and under very difficult circumstances. Because of the spring\u2019s healing powers Grimmialp became a health resort in the 19th century.

        "description": "Round trip hike in the picturesque region of the Diemtigtal. An unique mountain range with luscious green meadows, small waterfalls and little springs. The tour begins at Grimmialp and leads along Senggibach creek, which leisurely flows through pastures and lovely meadows. The scattered farms are soon behind you and at W\u00fcrzi you enter the forest. On shaded, pleasantly cool forest trails you continue up to Alp Grimmi. When you get to the mountain restaurant of the same name, you\u2019re probably ready for a break. If you\u2019re lucky you might even catch a glimpse of some chamois balancing between the steep grass slopes on the mountainside. Shortly thereafter you approach the mystical place of Grimmiwasser. While the water of the mineral spring is colourless, the iron dissolved in the water settles on the underground and provides a rusty red colour. Long ago, the Alpine herdsmen of the Diemtigtal Valley told their neighbours from the Simmental Valley about the healing powers of the Red Spring located all the way in the back of the Diemtigtal. The healing spring water was known far beyond the small mountain valley. For particularly serious illnesses, the water was picked up in barrels, jugs and bottles at the alp, even in winter and under very difficult circumstances. Because of the spring\u2019s healing powers Grimmialp became a health resort in the 19th century. For a few years, a water line was installed to transport the water directly from the spring to what was the Grimmialp sanatorium at that time. From the spring you continue in the direction of Stierenberg where you have an excellent view of the impressive cliff of the Fromattgrat peak. The path descends via Alp Nidegg.

The traces of the landslide stem from the fateful day on September 2, 1806, when a gigantic mass of rock broke from the slopes of the western ridge of the Rossberg and slid on a layer of clay and marl into the valley. Due to persistent heavy rainfalls this slide buried 102 homes of the R\u00f6then and Goldau hamlets under about 400 million m3 of debris. It even reached the western shore of Lake Lauerz where it caused a flood wave. Overall, 457 people and over 320 animals lost their lives in the disastrous event.

The Swiss Museum of Games in the castle at Tour-de-Peilz and famous Schloss Chillon are worth a visit before you reach the Chablais wine region. Am Ostrand des Rhonetals, inmitten der Weinberge des Chablais, beginnt die Wanderung von Aigle nach St. Maurice. Das Quartier du Bourg mit seinen schmalen G\u00e4sschen und H\u00e4usern, die eng beieinander stehen und teils durch Lauben verbunden sind, bildet den Mittelpunkt des St\u00e4dtchens. Bedeutendster Bau von Aigle ist das Schloss, an dem man kurz nach dem Start beim Bahnhof vorbeiwandert. Es wurde im 12. Jhdt. zum Schutz von Aigle erbaut und erm\u00f6glichte die Kontrolle des Zugangs ins Rhonetal und Pays d\u2019Enhaut.  Nach einem kurzen Waldst\u00fcck werden die n\u00e4chsten Weinberge rund um Ollon nach rund eineinhalb Stunden erreicht. Anschliessend wandert man wieder etwas hinauf, um schon bald wieder nach Antagnes abzusteigen. Die Aussicht \u00fcber das Rhonetal und die umliegenden Berge ist herrlich. Beim Fluss La Gryonne ist die H\u00e4lfte der Wanderung geschafft und beinahe schon alle H\u00f6henmeter.  Dem Fluss folgt man bis kurz vor dessen M\u00fcndung in die Rhone, welche man etwas sp\u00e4ter \u00fcberquert, um nach Massongex zu gelangen. Das Dorf war vor langer Zeit die Hauptstadt des keltischen Wallis. Hier folgt die letzte Wanderstunde zum Ziel der Etappe in St. Maurice. Pilger, die den gesamten Weg von Canterbury nach Rom wandern, befinden sich jetzt genau in der Mitte. Kurz vor St. Maurice passiert man die Feengrotte. Das Wasser hat hier den Felsen \u00fcber Jahrtausende ausgesp\u00fclt und die Grotte mit dem kleinen unterirdischen See und einem Wasserfall entstehen lassen. C\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 est de la vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne, au c\u0153ur du vignoble du Chablais, que commence la randonn\u00e9e d\u2019Aigle \u00e0 St-Maurice. Le quartier du Bourg avec ses ruelles \u00e9troites et ses maisons coll\u00e9es les unes aux autres, dont certaines sont reli\u00e9es par des arcades, constitue le point central de la petite ville. L\u2019\u00e9difice le plus important d\u2019Aigle est le ch\u00e2teau que l\u2019on longe peu apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9part de la gare. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit au 12e si\u00e8cle pour prot\u00e9ger Aigle et permettre le contr\u00f4le de l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne et au Pays d\u2019Enhaut. Apr\u00e8s un court passage par la for\u00eat, on atteint les prochains vignobles autour d\u2019Ollon apr\u00e8s environ une heure et demie de marche. Ensuite, on remonte un peu pour redescendre peu apr\u00e8s vers Antagnes. La vue sur la vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne et les montagnes environnantes est magnifique. Au niveau de la rivi\u00e8re la Gryonne, vous avez fait la moiti\u00e9 du chemin et franchi presque tous les m\u00e8tres de d\u00e9nivel\u00e9.  On suit la rivi\u00e8re jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son embouchure dans le Rh\u00f4ne, que vous traversez un peu plus tard pour arriver \u00e0 Massongex. Ce village \u00e9tait il y a fort longtemps la capitale du Valais celtique. Vous vous attaquez d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re heure de marche avant d\u2019arriver \u00e0 St-Maurice, terme de l\u2019\u00e9tape. Les p\u00e8lerins qui effectuent l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019itin\u00e9raire de Canterbury \u00e0 Rome se trouvent ici exactement au milieu du parcours. Peu avant St-Maurice, on passe devant la Grotte aux f\u00e9es. Au cours des mill\u00e9naires, l\u2019eau a creus\u00e9 la roche pour donner naissance \u00e0 cette grotte avec son petit lac souterrain et sa cascade.  Sulla sponda orientale della valle del Rodano, tra i vigneti dello Chablais, inizia l'escursione da Aigle a Saint-Maurice. Il Quartier du Bourg, con i suoi vicoli stretti e le case molto ravvicinate tra loro e in parte collegate da portici, costituisce il cuore della cittadina. L'edificio pi\u00f9 importante di Aigle \u00e8 il castello, a cui si giunge poco dopo la partenza dalla stazione ferroviaria. Fu costruito nel XII secolo per proteggere Aigle e controllare l'accesso alla valle del Rodano e al Pays d'Enhaut.  Dopo un breve tratto nel bosco, circa un'ora e mezza pi\u00f9 tardi, si raggiungono i vigneti intorno a Ollon. In seguito, si sale ancora un po' per scendere presto ad Antagnes. La vista sulla valle del Rodano e sulle montagne circostanti \u00e8 magnifica. Una volta raggiunto il fiume La Gryonne, si \u00e8 a met\u00e0 dell'escursione e si sono gi\u00e0 superati tutti i metri di dislivello.  Si segue il fiume fino a poco prima della sua confluenza nel Rodano, che viene attraversato poco dopo per raggiungere Massongex. Un tempo questo villaggio era la capitale del Vallese celtico. Qui inizia l'ultima ora di cammino verso la meta della tappa, Saint-Maurice. I pellegrini che percorrono l'intero cammino da Canterbury a Roma si trovano ora esattamente a met\u00e0 strada. Poco prima di Saint-Maurice, si passa davanti alla Grotta delle Fate. Qui l'acqua ha levigato la roccia nel corso di migliaia di anni e ha creato una grotta con un piccolo lago sotterraneo e una cascata. The hike from Aigle to St. Maurice begins on the eastern edge of the Rhone Valley, in the middle of the Chablais vineyards. The district of Bourg forms the heart of the little town. It is characterised by narrow streets and houses that stand close together and are partly connected by archways. The most important building in Aigle is the castle, which you pass shortly after the start of the stage at the train station. It was built in the 12th century to protect Aigle, and it enabled access to the Rhone Valley and Pays d'Enhaut to be controlled. After a short stretch of forest, you reach the next vineyards around Ollon in about one and a half hours. The hike is uphill for a while, then proceeds downwards again to Antagnes. There is an incredible view across the Rhone Valley and the surrounding mountains. At the Gryonne river, you are almost halfway through the hike and you have covered most of the altitude difference. You follow the river until just before it flows into the Rhone, which you cross a little later to arrive in Massongex. The village was the capital of Celtic Valais long ago. Now comes the final hour of the hike to the end of this stage in St. Maurice. Pilgrims walking all the way from Canterbury to Rome are now right in the middle of the route. Shortly before St. Maurice you pass the fairy grotto. The water has worn away the rock here for thousands of years, creating a grotto with a small underground lake and waterfall.",

        "description": "From Vevey the route follows the lake to Villeneuve. The Swiss Museum of Games in the castle at Tour-de-Peilz and famous Schloss Chillon are worth a visit before you reach the Chablais wine region. Am Ostrand des Rhonetals, inmitten der Weinberge des Chablais, beginnt die Wanderung von Aigle nach St. Maurice. Das Quartier du Bourg mit seinen schmalen G\u00e4sschen und H\u00e4usern, die eng beieinander stehen und teils durch Lauben verbunden sind, bildet den Mittelpunkt des St\u00e4dtchens. Bedeutendster Bau von Aigle ist das Schloss, an dem man kurz nach dem Start beim Bahnhof vorbeiwandert. Es wurde im 12. Jhdt. zum Schutz von Aigle erbaut und erm\u00f6glichte die Kontrolle des Zugangs ins Rhonetal und Pays d\u2019Enhaut.  Nach einem kurzen Waldst\u00fcck werden die n\u00e4chsten Weinberge rund um Ollon nach rund eineinhalb Stunden erreicht. Anschliessend wandert man wieder etwas hinauf, um schon bald wieder nach Antagnes abzusteigen. Die Aussicht \u00fcber das Rhonetal und die umliegenden Berge ist herrlich. Beim Fluss La Gryonne ist die H\u00e4lfte der Wanderung geschafft und beinahe schon alle H\u00f6henmeter.  Dem Fluss folgt man bis kurz vor dessen M\u00fcndung in die Rhone, welche man etwas sp\u00e4ter \u00fcberquert, um nach Massongex zu gelangen. Das Dorf war vor langer Zeit die Hauptstadt des keltischen Wallis. Hier folgt die letzte Wanderstunde zum Ziel der Etappe in St. Maurice. Pilger, die den gesamten Weg von Canterbury nach Rom wandern, befinden sich jetzt genau in der Mitte. Kurz vor St. Maurice passiert man die Feengrotte. Das Wasser hat hier den Felsen \u00fcber Jahrtausende ausgesp\u00fclt und die Grotte mit dem kleinen unterirdischen See und einem Wasserfall entstehen lassen. C\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 est de la vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne, au c\u0153ur du vignoble du Chablais, que commence la randonn\u00e9e d\u2019Aigle \u00e0 St-Maurice. Le quartier du Bourg avec ses ruelles \u00e9troites et ses maisons coll\u00e9es les unes aux autres, dont certaines sont reli\u00e9es par des arcades, constitue le point central de la petite ville. L\u2019\u00e9difice le plus important d\u2019Aigle est le ch\u00e2teau que l\u2019on longe peu apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9part de la gare. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit au 12e si\u00e8cle pour prot\u00e9ger Aigle et permettre le contr\u00f4le de l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne et au Pays d\u2019Enhaut. Apr\u00e8s un court passage par la for\u00eat, on atteint les prochains vignobles autour d\u2019Ollon apr\u00e8s environ une heure et demie de marche. Ensuite, on remonte un peu pour redescendre peu apr\u00e8s vers Antagnes. La vue sur la vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne et les montagnes environnantes est magnifique. Au niveau de la rivi\u00e8re la Gryonne, vous avez fait la moiti\u00e9 du chemin et franchi presque tous les m\u00e8tres de d\u00e9nivel\u00e9.  On suit la rivi\u00e8re jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son embouchure dans le Rh\u00f4ne, que vous traversez un peu plus tard pour arriver \u00e0 Massongex. Ce village \u00e9tait il y a fort longtemps la capitale du Valais celtique. Vous vous attaquez d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re heure de marche avant d\u2019arriver \u00e0 St-Maurice, terme de l\u2019\u00e9tape. Les p\u00e8lerins qui effectuent l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019itin\u00e9raire de Canterbury \u00e0 Rome se trouvent ici exactement au milieu du parcours. Peu avant St-Maurice, on passe devant la Grotte aux f\u00e9es. Au cours des mill\u00e9naires, l\u2019eau a creus\u00e9 la roche pour donner naissance \u00e0 cette grotte avec son petit lac souterrain et sa cascade.

        "description": "Nature and humans live together harmoniously in the Grande Cari\u00e7aie on the southern shore of Lake Neuch\u00e2tel. The nature reserve, Switzerland's largest lakeside wetland, is home to 800 plant species and over 10,000 animal species, who shape the banks under the friendly gaze of passing hikers. The walk begins in the town of Estavayer-le-Lac, whose narrow streets, with their many historical and architectural gems, are well worth a stroll. Worth a visit are for example the Gothic abbey church or the Savoy castle from the 12th century. Once leaving the city walls, nature opens up before you. In Font, you enter the Cheyres nature reserve. Only bikes and walkers are permitted from this point onwards. Take the time to listen to the frogs singing to their hearts\u2019 content, discover the little hidden beaches, observe the alert wildlife read the explanatory panels about the Grande Cari\u00e7aie. It comprises 8 nature reserves on a surface of 3000 ha and houses one third of the flora and a quarter of the fauna all over Switzerland.

The mountain church of St. Moritz towers over the vines; it is both eye-catching and a landmark. You continue on this kind of terrain for almost an hour. Not surprising, because this is the largest borderland vineyard landscape in German-speaking Switzerland. Pinot Noir, Riesling, Chardonnay, Pinot Gris and other grapes grow in the fertile soils.  Half an hour later comes the border with Germany, and it takes about 45 minutes to walk along here to just before St\u00fchlingen. Crossing the Schlaatemerbach stream, you climb up to the next vines and go through Schleitheim. Walking across wide fields, you reach the first range of hills in the Randen. The natural and cultural landscape in the Schaffhausen Regional Nature Park is unique: the Randen hills, the Rhine, the vineyards around Klettgau, the forests, typical villages and the huge agricultural areas give the area its diversity.  You then encounter the ruins of Randenburg Castle and the Schleitheimer Randenturm tower as you go uphill through the forest. The original wooden tower was built in 1872 and replaced with an iron one in 1909. During the Second World War, it served as an observation post for anti-aircraft troops.

Starting at Neuhausen Rheinfall rail station, the Schaffhausen Border Trail takes you past the roaring waterfall into the silent forests of Schaffhausen's South Randen area. There is evidence that bean ore (limonite) was mined in this region from the 16th century onwards, and probably since Roman times.

Along the way, you'll come to the Aazheimerhof, built in 1598 as the farm estate and summer residence of the Abbots of Rheinau. The estate has belonged to the City of Schaffhausen since 1936, and it is farmed and used by tenants. From national boundary stone no. 55, you follow the line of the border. At boundary stone no. 67, an erratic block of rock (also known as the \"Grey Stone\") rises out of a bean ore mine. This is the point where the districts of Beringen, Neunkirch and Jestetten (Germany) meet. The Linth glacier probably transported this huge boulder here from the Glarus or St. Gallen Oberland regions during the Riss glaciation, well over 200,000 years ago. The magnificent forest area between Erlenboden and the Wasen Hut is home to Sika deer, a breed that originated in China.  From the ruins of Radegg Castle, towering over the Wangen Valley on a rocky spur of Rossberg mountain, you will have a beautiful sweeping view of the Klettgau Valley where vines dominate the landscape.

Swiss perfection at the end of the route: immerse yourself in the history of time at the La Chaux-de-Fonds International Watch Museum. St. Imier nestles between Mont-Soleil and Chasseral. In 1992, what was then the largest solar power plant in Europe was built above the village. An adventure trail connects the energy plant with Switzerland\u2019s largest wind farm, Mont Crosin, which produces electricity for around twenty thousand households.

The thematic path explains this skill in more detail. The trail leads across mountain ridges and through wild canyons and is a good representation of the landscape in the Napf mountain area. If you walk from Romoos through the multilayered Napf area, you might suddenly smell smoke or see mysterious wisps rising from between the trees. Not to worry, it is not a forest fire. It is just the fumes of the smoldering charcoal kilns. The charburners of Romoos are building conical piles of different kinds of wood. Then they light them to generate charcoal. They monitor the process around the clock for a good two weeks. The production of \u201cblack gold\u201d is hard work.  For centuries the farmers have been producing charcoal as a secondary income. Romoos once had around 200 charburning places because blacksmiths, iron foundries and glassworks needed a great deal of charcoal then. Nowadays, the ancient craft is practiced by just a few farmers from the Napf area. They still produce as much as 100 tons every year. Making air holes, adding burnable material, extracting charcoal \u2013 with a bit of luck, you might be able to peek over the workers\u2019 shoulders on the hike between Romoos and Bramboden.

The route via Rose-Beizli, which is a little off the path, descends to the Seelibach brook and finally to Bramboden, crisscrossing Lucerne\u2019s Napf area. It passes steep cliffs and waterfalls, snakes through narrow ravines and climbs over sunny ridges. The area around Romoos is often compared to the Centovalli in the Ticino because of the similar topography. Bramboden, a place of pilgrimage, is a veritable gem. It is located in a side valley of the Entlebuch, far from any other village. A visit to the lovely mountain church, dedicated to St. Antonius of Padua, should not be missed, and the Pilgerbeizli restaurant is a perfect place to end the day.",

The route via Rose-Beizli, which is a little off the path, descends to the Seelibach brook and finally to Bramboden, crisscrossing Lucerne\u2019s Napf area. It passes steep cliffs and waterfalls, snakes through narrow ravines and climbs over sunny ridges. The area around Romoos is often compared to the Centovalli in the Ticino because of the similar topography. Bramboden, a place of pilgrimage, is a veritable gem. It is located in a side valley of the Entlebuch, far from any other village. A visit to the lovely mountain church, dedicated to St. Antonius of Padua, should not be missed, and the Pilgerbeizli restaurant is a perfect place to end the day."

The chapel was built in the late Middle Ages and the views from here across the village and the valley are marvellous.  A beautifully restored pathway then follows, some of it provided with large flagstones and stone steps. A small votive chapel in Braiaa contains frescoes by Giovanni Antonio Vanoni (1818-1886).

In addition to chapels and wayside shrines, you will also come across typical stone \u201crustici\u201d along the entire route.

The quiet resort of Kandersteg with a population of about 1000 is located at the foot of the L\u00f6tschen Pass.

The section where the pass road was blasted out of the Chluse is particularly spectacular.

To the south the 4000-metre peaks of Valais. On the gentle descent to the M\u00e4rjelensee lake, cotton grasses and small tarns contrast with the rock and ice. While the tour starts at a sophisticated site, the Villa Cassel on Riederfurka doesn\u2019t look like it belongs to this pristine environment. The castle-like structure was built around 1900 by Ernest Cassel, a wealthy English banker. Today it houses the Pro Natura Centre Aletsch. From here you first walk along Mor\u00e4nenweg on the border of the Aletsch Forest. The views of the Aletsch Glacier from H\u00e4rdernagrat Ridge are absolutely breathtaking. At over 22 km it is still the longest glacier in the Alps, but it is getting about 50 m shorter every year. The Jungfrau-Aletsch arena was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001.  A fantastic view of the Oberaletsch Glacier, the second-largest glacier in the Aletsch area, opens up between Sparrhorn and Fussh\u00f6rner mountains. The path leading to the Moosfluh cable car station is bordered by grasses and small shrubs. The long-range views of the glacier in the north and the 4000 m peaks of the Valais in the south, including the Dom and the Matterhorn, are amazing. This lovely hike passes a few small lakes and crosses fields of cotton grass and it feels like being on wheels. After a somewhat steeper ascent to Hohbalm the path turns left, always following the Aletsch Glacier and offering unforgettable sights. Shortly before the M\u00e4rjelensee lakes, Jungfraujoch and Monk Mountain appear far in the distance. The small lakes are located in a depression between Eggishorn and Strahlhorn.

        "description": "A string of vantage points provides a natural spectacle: to the north, the view of the Aletsch Glacier in the heart of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. To the south the 4000-metre peaks of Valais. On the gentle descent to the M\u00e4rjelensee lake, cotton grasses and small tarns contrast with the rock and ice. While the tour starts at a sophisticated site, the Villa Cassel on Riederfurka doesn\u2019t look like it belongs to this pristine environment. The castle-like structure was built around 1900 by Ernest Cassel, a wealthy English banker. Today it houses the Pro Natura Centre Aletsch. From here you first walk along Mor\u00e4nenweg on the border of the Aletsch Forest. The views of the Aletsch Glacier from H\u00e4rdernagrat Ridge are absolutely breathtaking. At over 22 km it is still the longest glacier in the Alps, but it is getting about 50 m shorter every year. The Jungfrau-Aletsch arena was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001.  A fantastic view of the Oberaletsch Glacier, the second-largest glacier in the Aletsch area, opens up between Sparrhorn and Fussh\u00f6rner mountains. The path leading to the Moosfluh cable car station is bordered by grasses and small shrubs. The long-range views of the glacier in the north and the 4000 m peaks of the Valais in the south, including the Dom and the Matterhorn, are amazing. This lovely hike passes a few small lakes and crosses fields of cotton grass and it feels like being on wheels. After a somewhat steeper ascent to Hohbalm the path turns left, always following the Aletsch Glacier and offering unforgettable sights. Shortly before the M\u00e4rjelensee lakes, Jungfraujoch and Monk Mountain appear far in the distance. The small lakes are located in a depression between Eggishorn and Strahlhorn. M\u00e4rjelensee, now also known as Hintersee, formed in the 19th century. At that time it was as much as 1.6 km long. Today, it barely measures 100 m.

Bellinzona is probably Switzerland's most Italian city. Three massive medieval castles dominate the townscape and tell the story of an embattled city. This is because of the city's strategic location in a narrow valley on the way to the Alpine passes of Gotthard, San Bernardino and Lukmanier.

After that, the populated area changes into a secluded, natural environment. A delightful trail leads steeply uphill through the forest to Cima di Dentro at an altitude of 1,000 metres. From here, a path paved in places with natural stones leads through pristine birch forests and between rocks down to Isone, where the Swiss army trains grenadiers and parachute reconnaissance forces.

From the jetty at Fl\u00fcelen, you hike into the cantonal capital of Altdorf. This stage is unique in that it is covered mainly by boat. It starts at the landing stage near the KKL (Lucerne Culture and Convention Centre). Once on the water, you can experience the rich biodiversity of Lake Lucerne. It was formed during the ice ages through erosion of the Reuss Glacier; the Reuss River, with a length of 164 kilometres, has its source in the Gotthard Massif. It leaves Lake Lucerne as a wide river with many bends and joins the Aare River at Windisch (330 metres above sea level) in the Canton of Aargau. The lake's name dates back to the four historic cantons surrounding it: Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden.  Offering breath-taking views of the Rigi and B\u00fcrgenstock, the boat after Viznau turns to enter the next lake basin. It feels like travelling on a small lake, but another lake basin opens up after each headland. At Brunnen, the boat turns into the Urnersee lake. On the right, you can see the R\u00fctli. On a slightly raised forest clearing, representatives of the original cantons in 1291 swore the oath of allegiance (R\u00fctlischwur), determining a joint approach to combat the foreign bailiffs in their valleys. It became the foundation for the Swiss Confederacy.  Axenstrasse runs along the left side of the lake. Until the road was built, the waterway served as the only connection to the north. After landing at Fl\u00fcelen, the route continues on foot for a short while toward the Canton of Uri's capital. Passing the commercial zone, swimming baths and a bird park, you follow the river until shortly before Altdorf.

The latter is the southern-most peak of the mountain range that separates the Turtmann Valley from Val d\u2019Anniviers and forms the German/French language border. Through the untouched landscape the trail continues above the forest to Holustei. Herdsmen once used the large hollowed-out boulder for protection or to sleep in. The view from the Holustei chapel to the Turtmann Glacier is stunning. Turtmann Hut is the starting point for Barrhorn (3610 m), one of Europe\u2019s highest hiking peaks, where no climbing equipment is needed. The trail now descends relatively steeply through larch and pine forests. Near Vorder S\u00e4nntum it reaches the Turtmann\u00e4, a Rhone tributary, originating from the Turtmann Glacier at 2300 m. Follow the lovely creek on the left side. This is where the Pfyn-Finges nature park begins. Across mountain pastures the trail approaches the Bl\u00fcomatt cheese-making shop and show dairy. Across the Turtm\u00e4nna and past the small chapel, forming the border between the hamlets of Gruben and Meiden, the road leads back to the starting point.",

        "description": "The name says it all: with views of the stunning Turtmann Glacier and the mountain range on the other side of the valley, the high-altitude trail leads through the pristine landscape to Holustei. After the descent through the forest, the route follows the lovely Turtm\u00e4nna creek back to Gruben/Meiden. The unspoiled Turtmann Valley is situated between the Turmtann Glacier in the south and the Rhone in the north. It is the western-most German-speaking southern valley in the Valais. Clusters of Alpine huts are perched on the valley floor and on the slopes. Once used to summer the cattle, they have mostly been converted to holiday chalets. But there is also the baroque chapel in Meiden from the early 18th century and Hotel Schwarzhorn in Gruben/Meiden where the loop trail starts. The trail first leads in the direction of Augstbordpass with several switchbacks through the forest. Shortly before Alp Gr\u00fcebu Mittelstafel it branches off in southern direction and into the valley. Here on the panoramic trail the name says it all: at the end of the valley the hikers catch sight of Turtmann Lake and the glacier which originates at the north-western slope of Bishorn.

The sights from the 374 meter pedestrian suspension bridge high above the Laui ravine come with an adrenalin kick. Rothenthurm is located in a high valley with an extensive moor landscape, including Switzerland\u2019s largest existing high moor. The name Rothenthurm comes from the Letzi Tower, built around 1323, with its red shingle roof. Another landmark of the village is the St. Antonius parish church, one of the region\u2019s most impressive. The M\u00e4derenweg starts immediately next to the church. It connects the popular moor path, which ends in Rothenthurm, with the High Trail of Schwyz on Mostelberg Mountain near Sattel. Leaving the last of the village behind, the path heads in the direction of Biberegg. Thereafter, we cross the Steiner Aa River, which flows into Lake Lauerz. This is where the actual climb begins, across meadows and through the forest. The panoramic views along the route are amazing, as you look back to the village of Rothen\u00acthurm with the peaceful Biberegg hamlet and across the high moor, into the Aegeri Valley with the lake of the same name, toward the Morgarten hills and the Wildspitz and Rossberg mountains. The Rigi massif, Mt. Pilatus and the Alps of Schwyz, Uri and Bern are all visible. On a clear day high above the fog, you may even see the Jura mountains and the Black Forest. On the last section, the route dips into the M\u00e4deren Forest. The highest point of the walk is located near the creek where the path descends slightly. The hike can be shortened by a few minutes just before reaching Mostelberg Mountain above Sattel - and this is quite spectacular - by crossing one of Europe\u2019s longest pedestrian suspension bridges. The \u201cRaiffeisen Skywalk\u201d above the Laui ravine has a span of 374 meters at a height of 58 meters. Looking from the bridge across the tree tops you will see the Aegeri Valley and the mountains. If your legs are tired when you arrive at the destination, there is another highlight ready for you on Mostelberg Mountain: the world\u2019s first revolving gondola down to the village of Sattel.

The MBC train (Morges-Bi\u00e8re-Cossonay) takes you from Morges to Bi\u00e8re, across vineyards and the countryside to the Jura foothills. The town is known throughout Switzerland as the site of an artillery and infantry military training area. From the Bi\u00e8re railway station, the route descends to the Aubonne river, which has its source here and flows into Lake Geneva after 12 kilometres. A pleasant trail with benches and picnic areas leads along the river. At the reservoir, the rivers Toleure and Sandoleyre join the Aubonne.   Once past the reservoir, botany enthusiasts can rejoice: above the vineyards of La C\u00f4te, a 200-hectare arboretum featuring more than 3,000 plant species from around the world awaits them. Marvel at over 200 maple species, oaks, magnolias, rosebushes, wetlands and Japanese katsura trees; they live up to their name in autumn, smelling of gingerbread and caramel. The tree and bush garden, created in 1968, is being managed by volunteers. You can choose between several circular paths with information panels. The arboretum is a delight for the eyes and nose and contributes to the conservation of species. The site includes an orchard with ancient varieties and a beautiful collection of apple trees and rosehip bushes. There's also a visitors' centre and a wood museum.  You eventually leave the arboretum in the direction of Saint-Livres. Coming out of the forest, enjoy splendid views of Aubonne and its round, white tower proudly overlooking the medieval town. The castle is a tribute to former Baron Jean-Baptiste Tavernier and his travels to the Orient. Next, the route branches off to the left and passes through Saint-Livres.

To get there, first climb up to Alpe Foppa (1530 m) with the cable car from Rivera, then continue on foot to the summit (1962 m) for approximately an hour and 30 min. walk.

This is followed by the last hour of the hike to Martigny, and you cross the Dranse shortly before the finish. La B\u00e2tiaz Castle sits proudly on a rock slightly above the river. Martigny is located on the Rhone bend in the Lower Valais. It is the hub of the pass routes via Simplon, Great St. Bernard and Forclaz."

High above Sion in one of Switzerland\u2019s driest regions is the Grand Bisse d'Ayent irrigation channel. Built in 1442 it draws water directly from the Lienne river below the wall of the Tseuzier dam (1777 m). The historic water conduit which is explored on this hike, irrigates the hills and vineyards of the towns of Ayent and Grimisuat. It carries water between June and October. The start near the dam can be reached by taking public transportation from Sion. The first 2 km or so in the Lienne Valley are very steep. Since the dam was completed in 1957, the upper part of the Bisse has been drained, but traces of the channel are still evident along the way. The Les Foll\u00e9s passage where the channel follows the rocky ridge is not for the faint-hearted. It is not recommended for anyone who suffers from vertigo. After the Le Samarin bus stop, where the trail crosses the road, the channel carries water. The path now follows the burbling channel with a gradient of only 1.5 \u2030 in some places.  But then the spectacular part begins: a passage of symbolic importance of this channel is the one in the rock face of Torrent-Croix. The incredible work of our forefathers is particularly striking here. They built the conduit on the mountainside with their bare hands, just a narrow channel made of boards and hugging the rocks. It was replaced in 1831 with a 95-m tunnel through which the water now flows. In 2019 the old channel was memorialised on the Swiss 100-franc bill and now the meaning is mostly sentimental. Still, this passage is head-spinning because there is a hole in the middle of the tunnel leading to a platform. The entire structure outside of the mountain can be clearly seen from there and it makes us understand the dangers to which the builders were exposed.

The hike into the Muotathal valley begins on the sunny terrace with great views over the Sch\u00e4chental valley, surrounded by magnificent mountain scenery. Hikers must climb about 500 metres to Chinzig Chulm (2,073 metres above sea level). After one and a half hours, you have made it. The summit panorama is also spectacular from the top of the pass, with the Rossstock, Chaiserstock, Hoch Pfaffen and Gl\u00e4rnisch in plain sight. Suvorov's troops set out towards the Chinzig Pass on 27 September at around five o'clock in the morning under the command of Prince Bagration. Despite insufficient supplies and equipment, they reached the pass, where a small chapel stands, around noon. However, the 22,000 Russians who were led over the pass into the Muotathal saw nothing of the surrounding mountains and the magnificent panoramic views. It was rainy and cold. After the pass, hikers descend via Chinzertal and W\u00e4ngi into the H\u00fcrlital valley. The latter is reached after about two hours. The path to the Muotathal steepens again here, with a 600-metre descent over a distance of three kilometres.  Despite the poor weather, Suvorov's first troops advanced from the H\u00fcrlital towards Muotathal around three o'clock in the afternoon. The unexpected appearance of the strange figures left a lasting impression on the population. The French did not expect the Russians to advance over the Chinzig Pass. They were taken by surprise, leading to roughly one company's capture. Some Frenchmen managed to escape to Schwyz. Village priest Lukas Geisser recalls the events: After the French had been put to flight, two horsemen armed with spears, sabres, and a pistol headed up the hill towards him.

Its name might suggest otherwise, but the Toblerone Trail will appeal more to history-lovers than those with a sweet tooth. \"Toblerones\" was the popular name for the tank traps set up as defensive lines between Bassins and Nyon in the second world war. Their triangular shape recalls the \"peaks\" of a Toblerone chocolate bar, and that explains the name given to the 3,000 or so concrete triangles \u2013 each as tall as a man. The \"Toblerones\" are arrayed along a stretch of about ten kilometers between the Jura foothills and Lake Geneva. An educational trail focusing on history follows the traps. Around 1940, when German troops were attacking neutral countries such as Belgium and Norway, fears also reached very high levels in Switzerland. This prompted the start of construction work on the \"Promenthouse Defence Line\": chunks of concrete were set up one after another along the courses of rivers and streams. Instead of removing them again, some were restored as a reminder of the war's importance for Switzerland. But military history is only one interesting aspect of the hike along these \"Toblerones\". This is also a paradise for nature-lovers: the massive tank traps tend to prevent intensive cultivation of the land, so they are now wreathed in moss and ivy \u2013 a welcoming habitat for many plants and animals.

But Villa Rose is not a cosy home: in fact, it is an ingeniously designed fortress. The windows turn out to be fake, and even the toilet has disguised slits for shooting at the enemy! On reaching the shore of Lake Geneva, the route crosses the golf course of the Domaine Imp\u00e9rial club. There is an air of grandeur about the clubhouse here.

Going downhill across the Riedengraben takes you to historic Meltingen, a place of pilgrimage, just a short while later. It is located in a cauldron at the upper end of Kaltbrunnen Valley surrounded by mountains and hills.  The path now drops down into a ravine and follows the Ibach River. The next section is a forest protection area. Deadwood is left untouched here, which is beneficial to many endangered species. For example, it creates a habitat for various insects and larvae and these, in turn, provide food for the birds. The gently burbling brook meanders through the untouched landscape. Bellflowers and other plants are growing on the side of the path. Many of the trees in this ravine are covered with moss, which gives them a mysterious look. In the spring the smell of wild garlic is everywhere and the many beautiful spots where you can rest your feet will make you want to linger.  After another hour, still in the ravine of the Chaltbrunnen Valley, you reach a karst area. An educational trail provides some information about the Ibachh\u00f6hle cave, the headwaters and archaeological finds of pre-historic hunters and gatherers. They lived here approximately 50,000 years ago, at the time of the Neanderthals, and sought shelter in the caves. After about four hours, you leave the valley.

The highest point of the walk is reached at Chastench\u00f6pfli (900 m). It takes approximately one hour to get there. The views on the way past B\u00e4renb\u00fcel are fantastic. Going downhill across the Riedengraben takes you to historic Meltingen, a place of pilgrimage, just a short while later. It is located in a cauldron at the upper end of Kaltbrunnen Valley surrounded by mountains and hills.  The path now drops down into a ravine and follows the Ibach River. The next section is a forest protection area. Deadwood is left untouched here, which is beneficial to many endangered species. For example, it creates a habitat for various insects and larvae and these, in turn, provide food for the birds. The gently burbling brook meanders through the untouched landscape. Bellflowers and other plants are growing on the side of the path. Many of the trees in this ravine are covered with moss, which gives them a mysterious look. In the spring the smell of wild garlic is everywhere and the many beautiful spots where you can rest your feet will make you want to linger.  After another hour, still in the ravine of the Chaltbrunnen Valley, you reach a karst area. An educational trail provides some information about the Ibachh\u00f6hle cave, the headwaters and archaeological finds of pre-historic hunters and gatherers. They lived here approximately 50,000 years ago, at the time of the Neanderthals, and sought shelter in the caves. After about four hours, you leave the valley. On forest and paved roads, above the Birs River and along the train tracks, it takes a good hour to get to the destination in Zwingen. The village is located in the Laufental Valley where L\u00fcssel and Birs meet."

While the walk to the peak of La Berra presents no technical challenges, it is rather steep. The charterhouse La Valsainte right after the start is an impressive sight. The walk begins at La Valsainte Monastery in the Gruy\u00e8re region of Fribourg, which is easy to reach by postbus. The Charterhouse, established in 1295, is the last active Carthusian monastery in Switzerland. The lives of the monks living here in seclusion are dedicated entirely to prayer. The monks are known for their silence and self-imposed solitude, one of the reasons why visits to the inside of the monastery are not permitted, except for a small chapel. But even from the outside, the architecture of the charterhouse with its rows of small buildings is striking. At first, the tour through the pristine Javro Valley heads westward, up to Gite d'Alli\u00e8res. On the way up, the landscape alternates between Alpine meadows and forests. The views of Mt. Mol\u00e9son and the Alpine foothills of Fribourg from the terrace of the mountain hut are amazing. The peak of La Berra at 1,719 meters is the highest point of the route. The treeless, grassy summit resembles a flat pyramid and offers a 360-degree panoramic view of Lake Gruy\u00e8re, across the Bernese Seeland and all the way to the Jura ridge. Signs are provided with the names of the mountains and the surrounding towns. The path continues mostly downhill with short uphill sections and across the ridge in the direction of Auta Chia d\u2019Amont with the sharp pinnacles of Les Recardets looming ahead. Kaiseregg Mountain is visible in the background with the Dents Vertes to the right. On the way back to La Valsainte the hikers may catch sight of the typical chalets covered by wooden shingles. These are part of the cultural heritage of Fribourg: La Guisolanda, for example, or the pasture Les F\u00e9guelenets after a forested section of the trail.

Polished by natural forces, the rock faces have the shape of a human face and the head of a legendary monster. The trail leads to the Saut du Doubs, a spectacular, 27m high waterfall. In Les Brenets, first referred to as Chez le Bruinet in 1325, the industrialisation began in the 18th century. Precision mechanics, particularly watchmaking, experienced a veritable boom here and in Le Locle and it is still an important industrial branch to this day. The tour starts at the train station of Les Brenets. A paved road leads in the direction of the Restaurant Saut-du-Doubs. Along the way, you can see Lac des Brenets below, which was formed by the Doubs River. Through wild, fjord-like ravines with naturally polished rocks you continue to the Saut du Doubs, a 27 metre waterfall. In the winter, when the Doubs is frozen, this is one of Europe\u2019s largest natural ice rinks.  The torrential river forming the border between France and Switzerland soon turns into Lac de Moron, which is smooth as glass. Follow the path above the lake to the wall of the dam. Once past it, the previously open and expansive landscape changes to a lovely environment, but it drops off steeply. This change in the scenery and the moss-covered trees are typical for the Doubs Nature Park. And so are the mills, which used to be located at various places along the Doubs, at C\u00f4te des Moulins Calame, for example. The licenses to operate the mills are dated as far back as 1573. The building was restored after it was destroyed by a fire in 1734. Four mills were in operation at that time, including a sawmill and a forge. The mills are named after Abraham-Louis Calame. His son gave them up in 1832 and the Canton Neuch\u00e2tel acquired them in 1842, but from 1880 on, they were left to deteriorate.  After about three hours or so, you reach the Torret electric power station. Years ago you could even find glassworks along the Doubs. They were built there because the wood from the area was utilised, but because of the steepness of the terrain, it could not be transported to the villages.

        "description": "Picturesque and rugged ravines that could almost be called fiords open up after Les Brenets. Polished by natural forces, the rock faces have the shape of a human face and the head of a legendary monster. The trail leads to the Saut du Doubs, a spectacular, 27m high waterfall. In Les Brenets, first referred to as Chez le Bruinet in 1325, the industrialisation began in the 18th century. Precision mechanics, particularly watchmaking, experienced a veritable boom here and in Le Locle and it is still an important industrial branch to this day. The tour starts at the train station of Les Brenets. A paved road leads in the direction of the Restaurant Saut-du-Doubs. Along the way, you can see Lac des Brenets below, which was formed by the Doubs River. Through wild, fjord-like ravines with naturally polished rocks you continue to the Saut du Doubs, a 27 metre waterfall. In the winter, when the Doubs is frozen, this is one of Europe\u2019s largest natural ice rinks.  The torrential river forming the border between France and Switzerland soon turns into Lac de Moron, which is smooth as glass. Follow the path above the lake to the wall of the dam. Once past it, the previously open and expansive landscape changes to a lovely environment, but it drops off steeply. This change in the scenery and the moss-covered trees are typical for the Doubs Nature Park. And so are the mills, which used to be located at various places along the Doubs, at C\u00f4te des Moulins Calame, for example. The licenses to operate the mills are dated as far back as 1573. The building was restored after it was destroyed by a fire in 1734. Four mills were in operation at that time, including a sawmill and a forge. The mills are named after Abraham-Louis Calame. His son gave them up in 1832 and the Canton Neuch\u00e2tel acquired them in 1842, but from 1880 on, they were left to deteriorate.  After about three hours or so, you reach the Torret electric power station. Years ago you could even find glassworks along the Doubs. They were built there because the wood from the area was utilised, but because of the steepness of the terrain, it could not be transported to the villages. For example, the glassworks of Blancheroche used approximately 100 cubic metres of wood per month. Because the glassmakers continued to relocate as soon as the fuel was used up in a particular area, the Neuch\u00e2tel authorities soon prohibited the operation of glassworks on their land.

Via the fascinating villages of Meride and Tremona you reach \u00abMagnifico Borgo\u00bb Mendrisio, famous for its elegant historic buildings. The stage begins at the pier in Morcote, where the boat takes you over the water to Brusino Arsizio in a few minutes. If you'd rather not travel by boat, you can start your hike directly on the other side of the lake. Here, the path quickly leads into the forest, and a steep, varied ascent to Serpiano begins. Alternatively, you can deal with the altitude difference by taking the Brusino Arsizio \u2013 Serpiano cable car. On a plateau on the western slope of Monte San Giorgio lies the Spa Hotel Serpiano. You will soon reach the route's highest point at Casa Doganale, 669 metres above sea level. A slightly descending trail leads on gravel roads and forest paths through the valley between Monte Pravello and Monte San Giorgio to Meride.  Two hundred forty million years ago, there was a 100-metre-deep ocean basin here. Due to numerous spectacular fossil finds, the area was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Some of the finds are on display in the fossil museum in Meride. Nestled between gently rolling hills, the town with its pantile roofs is reminiscent of Tuscany. The buildings have spacious courtyards with porticoes, elaborately laid cobblestones, elegant iron doors and wall fountains. The village is situated in a landscape characterised by viticulture and was once home to many artists.  Winding forest trails lead downhill and climb again on the eastern slope to the village of Tremona. On the way, a cosy grotto invites you to play petanque with fantastic views. In the archaeological park in Tremona, the remains of a medieval settlement have been uncovered. They allow a detailed reconstruction of everyday life in the Middle Ages, which can be viewed through 3-D glasses.  Now a long descent takes you via Rancate to the industrial area of Mendrisio. Walking along the Morea, you reach the stage's destination at the railway station.

Fascinating views down to the trains of the L\u00f6tschberg Railway, which roll through the Kandertal like a model railway. Kiental is one of the large side valleys of the Kandertal Valley in the Bernese Oberland and located in the middle of an intact natural environment. The village of the same name is also the starting point of the chairlift to Ramslauenen. From Reichenbach in the Kandertal at the beginning of the Kiental valley, Europe\u2019s steepest postbus route leads via Kiental village to Griesalp. Pochtenschlucht gorge, for example, has a gradient of up to 28%. During the ride, the environment changes from a lovely valley to a rugged high mountain landscape. The hiking trail starts in Kiental, at the base station of the chairlift. The first 500 altitude metres of the tour are strenuous and take roughly 1 \u00bd hours, but once you have reached Ramslauenen, the worst is over. A beautiful path follows and leads through Horewald forest. A little later, above Ch\u00fceweid, the views of the Kandertal Valley open up with Niesen Mountain and its steep cog railway to the left, and down in the valley you can see the trains of the L\u00f6tschberg railway line. Part of Lake Thun is visible straight ahead and on the right are the grassy mountainsides of Beatenberg and the steep wall of Niederhorn peak. Continue on the pleasant paths through short sections of forest and meadows to get to Schlafegg after about two hours.  Shortly before the impressive notch of Bundergraben comes a precipitous passage, secured with ropes. But the path following the pleasant grilling place near Bundergraben is just delightful. It winds through a coniferous forest before it changes to an asphalt and gravel road. Again the views of the railway line and the L\u00f6tschberg trains down in the valley are fantastic. As they roll through the Kandertal they look almost like model trains. Because of the steepness, the train describes two big loops around the old Felsenburg ruins. The route continues downhill on forest paths and about one kilometre before Kandersteg it crosses the Kander. The 47 km long river originates at Kanderfirn and later flows through Lake Thun and into the Aare River. The name Kander comes from the Celtic word \u201ckando\u201d and means \u201cwhite\u201d or \u201cshining\u201d, a reference to the light cloudiness caused by the glacier\u2019s meltwater.

Br\u00fcnig Pass, known for the famous Swiss wrestling competition, connects Central Switzerland with the Bernese Oberland. With an altitude of just 1002 m the pass is open all year and popular with motorcycle riders. This stage begins at the cogwheel railway station and requires a bit of stamina.

The first ascent of this stage is now behind you and the path begins to go down to the Melchtal Valley. Across Alp Chrummelbach with its lovely Alpine chapel and over the Small Melchaa, the trail continues on the other side of the valley through forests and meadows and leads up to the central point of Switzerland. By now you have been hiking for about five hours.  The geographic centre of Switzerland was established in 1988 at \u00c4lggi-Alp using the latest measuring technology, i.e. a triangulation pyramid. At that time, Switzerland\u2019s Federal Office of Topology celebrated its 150-year anniversary. A stone wall in the shape of Switzerland was constructed around the centre. The country\u2019s exact geographic centre is actually located further to the southeast, but because it is not easily accessible right above a rocky cliff, the location was shifted by about 500 meters.

Part of the forest trail runs through the narrow valley between steep cliffs, climbs high above the gorge and passes through several tunnels. Every now and then you have gorgeous views of the surrounding peaks of the Sesvenna group. Through the rocks on the valley floor and past coniferous trees the path continues steadily uphill. At an altitude of almost 1,500 m the valley opens up for the first time and Alp Uina Dadora comes into view.

The steep cliffs of the Uina Gorge are visible in the south.  Between Piz Rims and Piz da Gliasen a 600 m long path was blasted into the limestone rock wall to create a passage through the gorge. The path is about a meter wide and part of it runs below the projecting rock face. In some places it is secured with ropes and handrails. You also pass through two short, but unlit tunnels, high above the river. You must be surefooted here and have no fear of heights. As late as the 1970s, coffee and cigarettes were smuggled to the Italian South Tyrol on this trail. You continue on a path leading through broad Alpine pastures where the cattle is peacefully grazing. Numerous creeks are flowing through the high valley. Near the national border, at an altitude of about 2,300 m, you reach the Schlinig moorland with its clear mountain lakes. A bit below the Schlinig Pass is the cosy and welcoming Sesvenna Hut of the Alpine Club of South Tyrol. Two small mountain lakes and extensive meadows are located right next to the hut.",

You also pass through two short, but unlit tunnels, high above the river. You must be surefooted here and have no fear of heights. As late as the 1970s, coffee and cigarettes were smuggled to the Italian South Tyrol on this trail. You continue on a path leading through broad Alpine pastures where the cattle is peacefully grazing. Numerous creeks are flowing through the high valley. Near the national border, at an altitude of about 2,300 m, you reach the Schlinig moorland with its clear mountain lakes. A bit below the Schlinig Pass is the cosy and welcoming Sesvenna Hut of the Alpine Club of South Tyrol. Two small mountain lakes and extensive meadows are located right next to the hut."

If you wish to travel to the Gotthard Pass the way they did in the times of the legendary Gotthard stagecoach in the mid-19th century, book a trip with the old, five-horse post coach. Or go even further back in time and choose the footpath. The muleteers transported their goods on this route as far back as the 13th century. At that time, the Gotthard Pass became one of the most important Alpine crossings. Who knew that traffic congestion on the Gotthard was problematic even then? Nowadays cars are held up in traffic jams before they get to the tunnel, but for hikers the way is clear. A comfortable flat trail leads through the romantic Urseren Valley between Andermatt and Hospental. Along the Reuss and past the Alpine golf course of Andermatt you reach Hospental, the last stop before the path begins to climb. The town benefited from the busy traffic in the olden days as the many inns and the old customs station show.

The path leads through a moor landscape with a wide variety of Alpine flora.  Shortly before the top, on your right you see the huge dam looming at the Lago di Lucendro reservoir, the source of the Gotthard-Reuss.

So the ViaSuworow follows the route of the Russians from Altdorf into the Sch\u00e4chental valley, where cobbled cattle tracks bordered by drystone walling lead to Biel-Chinzig. On 26 September 1799, Suvorov arrived with his troops in Altdorf. The threatening mountains and gloomy ravines faded into the background on the broad valley plain. However, not the entire army had made it to Altdorf, and many soldiers were exhausted from the exertions. Hunger compounded the situation. The supply train had stayed behind, and the French had largely plundered the country.  The fifth stage of the ViaSuworow is, first and foremost, dedicated to Switzerland's national hero, starting at the Tell monument in the centre of Altdorf. The bronze statue, inaugurated in 1895, presents William Tell with his crossbow shouldered together with his son, Walter. After a short walk through the old town and past the industrial area of Altdorf, you reach B\u00fcrglen after about half an hour. The beautiful Marienkirche of \"burgulione\" was first mentioned in a document in 817. The name B\u00fcrglen comes from the Latin burgus (castle). Right next to the church is the Tell Museum. Continuing through residential quarters and along dry-stone walls for another hour, you arrive at Br\u00fcgg.  There was no way for Suvorov to march from Altdorf via Fl\u00fcelen directly to Schwyz or Lucerne. The lake would have been the only connection, but all the ships had been taken away by the French. Therefore, despite overtired troops, he set out for Muotathal the following day. The night of 27 September was rainy and cold. At higher altitudes, there was even some snow. Remarkably, Suvorov ordered his exhausted and starving troops over the pass, given that the equipment, especially the footwear, had also been severely affected on the way to Altdorf.  Today's hiking boots are much more comfortable. For about 45 minutes, the trail leads along the Sch\u00e4chen valley to Gr\u00fcndli, where the occasionally steep 900-metre ascent begins. Scenic paths and cattle trails, partly enclosed by old dry-stone walls or a stile fence, climb to an altitude of over 1,600 metres above sea level. Along the way: magnificent views over the Reuss valley and the surrounding peaks of T\u00f6di, Gross Windg\u00e4llen and Gross Spannort. The stage ends on the sun terrace at Biel-Chinzig. *Background information and quotations stages 55.1-55.9: Alois Camenzind (1992), Maultiere machen Geschichte oder Suworows Krieg in den Schweizer Alpen im Jahre 1799, Luzern: Verlag Pro Libro Luzern GmbH",

The Ergolztal and Homburgertal valleys are home to impressive castles and massive fortress ruins as well as Switzerland's oldest railway bridges. From Liestal railway station, the route takes a detour through the historic town past the Wehrmannsbrunnen (fountain), the Gothic city hall and to the upper gate dating back to the 13th century. Along the second leg of Via Gottardo, the focus is on railway history: Your first stop is at the Frenkenbr\u00fccke industrial monument, Switzerland\u2019s oldest preserved railway bridge. In 2005, the last train crossed this 1854-built wrought-and-cast-iron truss bridge. At Altmarkt, known for its ancient crossing keeper\u2019s hut, the rails of SBB and Waldenburger line separate. Nevertheless, Lausen plays a vital role in freight service. Here the route briefly leaves the valley bottom and climbs up to the reservoir. With views of the railway line, you reach Itingen and its compact row houses.  Less compact is the imposing, late-Baroque Ebenrain Castle at the entrance to Sissach. Built as a country estate by Basel-based silk manufacturer Martin Bachofen in 1774/75, it nowadays serves the Regierungsrat (cantonal government) as a venue for receptions. The park, courtyard and veranda are accessible to the public. At Sissach, the main SBB line Basel-Olten via the Hauenstein base tunnel separates from the old Hauenstein line, which will take centre stage for the rest of the hike. The old Hauenstein Tunnel is considered Switzerland\u2019s first mountain tunnel and was even celebrated as the \u201cfallen barrier of global transport\u201d back in 1858. Various structures catch your eye along the route: embankments, bridges, retaining walls and tunnels. In addition to the Hauenstein summit tunnel itself, the viaduct near R\u00fcmlingen is particularly impressive. It is 128 metres long and consists of eight arches. This structure has often inspired artists such as Ferdinand Hodler. Under the viaduct, the route moves away from the railway line a second time.  After passing through H\u00e4felfingen and along the forest edge, you can soon make out the ruins of Homburg Castle. It is accessible to the public, and the three-level fortified tower is imposing. The viewing platform offers sweeping views of the surrounding Jura mountains. Head downhill through the forest, and you\u2019re almost at this leg\u2019s final destination. During the walk you cannot fail to notice that the track is used by different train compositions: from the goods train up to the elegant high speed train.  At the stage places Liestal, Sissach and L\u00e4ufelfingen there are special information boards which inform about the times of walk and the railway history.",

From here, you can reach the spa resort of Ovronnaz in 30 minutes.  \u00a0 The route separates off from the path to Ovronnaz, crossing the stream Salentze and heading up towards Bougnone (1,864m). When you reach Alp Bougnone, the route traverses woods and meadows at roughly the same altitude to reach Petit-Pr\u00e9 (1,996m).

T\u00e4sch was not always at the same location. T\u00e4sch was buried under a massive rockslide at T\u00e4schgufer sometime before 1400 according to the handed down tradition.

In the local dialect, \u201cGufer\u201d means \u201cscree\u201d or \u201crubble.\u201d \u00a0 The Trufferhaus is one of the most valuable buildings in the village. It was built in 1766 and is therefore one of the village\u2019s oldest structures. It is an example of the true Valais style with the south side timbered on wood and the north side built on stonework. It has been renovated but is not occupied. Here the Kronig brothers once lived who worked as blacksmiths, saddlers and coopers. Later, the building was the home of the Truffer family. Other renovated Valais houses in the village are beautiful subjects for those taking photographs. \u00a0 Wherever one looks, large and small buildings can be seen that have the typical dark, weathered larch wood colouring. Until 1950, most of the residents made their living from farming. Barns, granaries and stables were their farm buildings. These are wooden structures for grain, stocks, provisions, cows and small animals. The barns are built on round, stone slabs, which keep the mice out. Granaries served as storage space for food, grain, flour and dried meat. \u00a0 The catchment area of the stream reaches from the slopes of the Rothorn over the Rimpfischhorn to the Alphubel, all of which are mighty four thousand-metre peaks. The stream has behaved accordingly: it has been the cause of flooding several times: 1870, 1957 and 2001. Construction measures at Weingartensee, on T\u00e4schalp and in the streambed have quieted the stream. The Mattertal is a low precipitation valley. Therefore, it can happen that the waterfall at the beginning of the village is just a trickle. \u00a0 Two old wooden structures always draw attention. Once or twice a year, the residents gather in the old Backhaus to bake sourdough bread together. The result is the typical Valais rye bread. And between Christmas and New Year, the Old Mill is brought back to life. \u00a0 Families with children and those seeking relaxation will enjoy a refreshing swim in Schalisee.

Construction measures at Weingartensee, on T\u00e4schalp and in the streambed have quieted the stream. The Mattertal is a low precipitation valley. Therefore, it can happen that the waterfall at the beginning of the village is just a trickle. \u00a0 Two old wooden structures always draw attention. Once or twice a year, the residents gather in the old Backhaus to bake sourdough bread together. The result is the typical Valais rye bread. And between Christmas and New Year, the Old Mill is brought back to life. \u00a0 Families with children and those seeking relaxation will enjoy a refreshing swim in Schalisee. Grill with table and benches, small drinks and restaurant hut, playground, WC. Offered in summer: water-skiing, nearby golf course.

The scenery at the top is unforgettable. No wonder it is jam-packed with tourists during the summer months. Some take selfies at the sparkling mountain lakes, while others step back in time and visit the national St. Gotthard Museum or the Sasso San Gottardo defence installation. Few people know that the Gotthard Pass is also an important water divide with the sources of Rhine, Rhone, Reuss and Ticino all within this area.  Just a couple of minutes on the historic mule trail and the clamour is behind you. Heading south toward Airolo you pass the Chapel of the Dead and then the partly paved mule trail meanders down and across meadows scattered with rocks. Soon you will spot the world-famous Tremola road. The landmarked mountain pass is one of the highlights of today\u2019s hike. It descends 340 altitude meters through 24 turns. Post coaches used to clatter down the road in the olden days. Now it is popular with mountain bikers and motorcycle riders. The hikers are very close to this impressive structure, which is perfectly embedded in the terrain. They cross this awe-inspiring road with retaining walls of as much as 8 m multiple times and in some places they even walk on it. Mother Nature is also part of the scenery: while the roar of an engine might occasionally disturb the peace, you will also hear marmots whistling nearby and if you pay attention, you\u2019ll even see a few away from the road. The upper part of the route is all about the old road and the muleteers, but the second section represents a different time. You see the Gotthard highway down in the valley and the new road across the pass. Crossing under a viaduct brings the former Motto Bartola defence structure into view, now a Swiss Army base. A narrow mountain trail leads past it and continues through meadows and short forest areas. The last section of the path down to Airolo offers a fantastic view of the Leventina Valley and the surrounding mountains. The trail passes through the lovely old town centre with its winding lanes and heads for the train station below. Airolo is a crossroads of traffic routes from different eras: the old 13th century mule track, the old railway tunnel which opened in 1882 and the Gotthard road tunnel, built approximately 100 years later.

Ascent to St. Martin, which clings to the side of the Val d\u2019H\u00e9rens like an eagle\u2019s nest. Veysonnaz, a small holiday resort at an altitude of around 1,200 metres, offers views across the Rhone Valley, the northern Valais Alpine chain and the glacial Plaine Morte.   The hike takes you along the Bisse de Vex, a historical irrigation canal built in the early 15th century. Following extensive renovation, this bisse carries fresh water from the mountain streams to the dry pastures, fields, vineyards and orchards along its entire route of more than 12 kilometres.   As soon as you leave the wooded sections, you reach Les Mayens-de-Sion. En route, while exploring the village, you will come across various chapels that are hidden in the forest, which are marked as being part of the former patriciate of Sitten / Sion. The patriciate of Sion played an important role in the government and administration of the town for generations. In the summer, the patrician families moved up to the \u201cMaiens\u00e4sse\u201d or summer residences, such as Les Mayens-de-Sion, to escape the heat of the city. They spent a few months in their chalets there, which were luxuriously furnished for the time and were considered to be status symbols. To ensure that the noble bourgeoisie did not want for anything so far from the town, a post office, a grocery shop and of course chapels for Sunday mass were built.   The next place on the route is H\u00e9r\u00e9mence. The church of St. Nicholas is an impressive sight of interest. It was dedicated to Saint Nicholas and designed by Basel architect Walter F\u00f6rderer, who built it like a concrete rock in the middle of the village.

The view across the little Chammseeli lake to the Triassic series on Schn\u00fcerligrat is fascinating. From the Spitzmeilen hut, you can enjoy a fantastic view of the Churfirsten peaks and the Alvier group. The modern refuge was built next to a spring in 1903 with the emergence of the ski sport. It is situated at an altitude of 2,087 metres on the steep slope of the Fetschench\u00f6pf.  The trail leads rapidly uphill on the northern slope to an altitude of 2,204 metres. All across the vast alpine meadows, you encounter occasional snow pockets, streams and boulders. Here you are far away from any civilisation. The panoramic view below the dominant Spitzmeilen peak over the ridges that will be crossed in the further course of the hike is very impressive. The gypsum ridge with its differently coloured rock layers is also clearly visible from here. On the Schaffans plateau, the path leads over yellow-white dolomite rock. It was formed at sea level between 250 and 300 million years ago and is now gradually dissolved by the rain and carried back into the sea. Fascinating channel-shaped formations and depressions in the terrain bear witness to this process. The highest point of the route is reached at the Oxni summit above the Chammseeli lake. At an altitude of just under 2,400 metres, the panoramic view is unrivalled. You can see the Weisstannen valley, the Piz Sardona, the Spitzmeilen, the Churfirsten, the Alvier group and as far as the S\u00e4ntis.  Now the trail follows a ridge across high alpine meadows with partly steep slopes on both sides. With a view over the Pr\u00e4ttigau region and small mountain lakes, the trail continues steadily up and down over Fulegg, past Guli and up to the Madchopf. The main Glarus overthrust is clearly visible on Madfurggl. The distinct horizontal line in the mountain separates the verrucano rocks, which are up to 300 million years old, from the Flysch rocks or limestones, which are 200 million years younger and atop which they are located. Now, on a steep and long descent, more than 1,100 metres in altitude difference are covered. At first, the trail runs downhill just above the Logsbach stream. After crossing the T\u00fcfwald forest, it then heads east to circle the Ringgenstein. The semicircular rock face, up to eighty metres high, gleams impressively on the wooded slope. In wide serpentines and soon on a gravel road, the route continues over the Seez and into the small village of Weisstannen.  The Walser people had settled here as early as the 14th century. Even today, the scenery with the old post office, the village sawmill, the alpine dairy and the rafting on the stream bear witness to the former way of life in the Weisstannen valley.",

The mountain stream flows below the path. For a few metres, the route continues along Schlappinsee lake, which invites you to fish, splash around and linger. After the tiny Walser settlement of Schlappin, the trail branches off to the left and continues uphill, albeit somewhat less steeply.  Continuing through a fairy-tale forest with beautiful streams, giant mushrooms and lush green grass, you leave the tree line behind. It is worth looking to the east, where the Schlappiner valley now opens up. Wine and cattle, among other things, were traded via the mule track over the Schlappiner-Joch. In 1622, this was a war zone during a conflict between Graub\u00fcnden and Montafon.   Along the steep slope, you reach the Z\u00fcgenh\u00fcttli. At the next junction, the trail continues to the right. Turning left would take you to the Madrisa cable car with its adventure park for families. The long stage could be divided into two parts here.  Further uphill, past the Obers\u00e4ss, you reach the Ch\u00fcecalanda, where the marmots sound the alarm if you get too close. In the back, you can see the three-thousand-metre peaks of the Grisons Alps, the Weissfluh above Klosters and the Pischahorn above Davos.

Following the ascent via a lush green southern slope, the route descends again across a gravel landscape on the northern slope. Metre by metre, the scenery turns greener as you leave the Gafier slabs behind you. Affording views of the Madrisajoch and the Gafier Joch, the route continues. A little later, the Sulzfluh and the Drusenfluh are visible to the north. The latter two mountains are suitable for climbing.  Shortly before Hochstelli, at the source of the Gafierbach stream, you look down into the valley over the steeply dropping Plattenfluh. Following along the creek, you reach the Sunnistafel. Rockfalls characterise the primaeval landscape in the lower part of the Gafia valley, making farming difficult. It is still the most important economic sector in the high valley of St. Ant\u00f6nien.

The route then follows the ridge before leading down to Sornetan. Moutier, the capital of the Bernese Jura, lies between two impressive gorges of the Faltenjura (Jura folds) in the valley basin of the Birs. Surrounded by deep valleys, gorges and wild nature, the town has much to offer with its cobblestone streets. The first machine tools were built here, and industry continues to play a vital role here. The route starts in the east of Moutier at the railway station. Along the Birs, you cross the town, reach La Chali\u00e8re and then branch off to the left to follow the pretty little La Foule stream into a gorge. Wooded rocky slopes rise to the left and right, and at a bend, you suddenly find yourself directly in front of a massive, round rock face. Continue on a narrow path through the forest and past old military installations to reach Gorges de Court.  Here the Birs flows through a rocky gorge, and the route initially runs parallel to the road for about five minutes. After an underpass, continue along the banks of the Birs, where the rushing water drowns out the noise of the road. Polished and moss-covered stones lie between the roots of the trees and their branches in the riverbed. In places, the path leads directly along massive rock faces. A narrow pedestrian tunnel in the rock and wooden footbridges make the passage easier.  Behind the gorge, you reach Court. The path branches off to the right and crosses the steep slope at the forest edge north of the village. On beautiful flower meadows, you can see over the Vall\u00e9e de Tavannes. Behind Champoz, the steep climb on the Moron begins. Through the forest, you reach the broad ridge. Dead-straight dry-stone walls stretch across the hills, where several mountain farms lie between extensive Jura pastures.  The route continues on a gravel road with a reduced gradient to the Moron Tower. The observation tower, designed by Mario Botta, offers panoramic views of the Alps, the Chasseral, Mont Soleil and the Black Forest. Because several steps broke off in 2022, the tower had to be temporarily closed (as of summer 2023). At an altitude of 1,319 metres, the hike's highest point is reached. Now a bright, straight gravel road leads downhill through the Jura pastures. Past molehills, beautiful trees and horse pastures, you come to the Pr\u00e8s de la Montagne farm. The trail turns here and heads north to Sornetan. Less than four kilometres farther west is the former abbey of Bellelay, where the T\u00eate de Moine was developed in the 12th century. After about one and a half hours, you reach Sornetan, a small village around 100 metres above the valley floor. Several typical farmsteads from the 18th and 19th centuries characterize the place.",

Surrounded by deep valleys, gorges and wild nature, the town has much to offer with its cobblestone streets. The first machine tools were built here, and industry continues to play a vital role here. The route starts in the east of Moutier at the railway station. Along the Birs, you cross the town, reach La Chali\u00e8re and then branch off to the left to follow the pretty little La Foule stream into a gorge. Wooded rocky slopes rise to the left and right, and at a bend, you suddenly find yourself directly in front of a massive, round rock face. Continue on a narrow path through the forest and past old military installations to reach Gorges de Court.  Here the Birs flows through a rocky gorge, and the route initially runs parallel to the road for about five minutes. After an underpass, continue along the banks of the Birs, where the rushing water drowns out the noise of the road. Polished and moss-covered stones lie between the roots of the trees and their branches in the riverbed. In places, the path leads directly along massive rock faces. A narrow pedestrian tunnel in the rock and wooden footbridges make the passage easier.  Behind the gorge, you reach Court. The path branches off to the right and crosses the steep slope at the forest edge north of the village. On beautiful flower meadows, you can see over the Vall\u00e9e de Tavannes. Behind Champoz, the steep climb on the Moron begins. Through the forest, you reach the broad ridge. Dead-straight dry-stone walls stretch across the hills, where several mountain farms lie between extensive Jura pastures.  The route continues on a gravel road with a reduced gradient to the Moron Tower. The observation tower, designed by Mario Botta, offers panoramic views of the Alps, the Chasseral, Mont Soleil and the Black Forest. Because several steps broke off in 2022, the tower had to be temporarily closed (as of summer 2023). At an altitude of 1,319 metres, the hike's highest point is reached. Now a bright, straight gravel road leads downhill through the Jura pastures. Past molehills, beautiful trees and horse pastures, you come to the Pr\u00e8s de la Montagne farm. The trail turns here and heads north to Sornetan. Less than four kilometres farther west is the former abbey of Bellelay, where the T\u00eate de Moine was developed in the 12th century. After about one and a half hours, you reach Sornetan, a small village around 100 metres above the valley floor. Several typical farmsteads from the 18th and 19th centuries characterize the place."

Plenty of places for refreshment and playgrounds en route. At ten kilometres, the second stage of the Swiss Path is the longest, but as it follows the shore of the lake, it is also the easiest. On the section between Isleten and Fl\u00fcelen, the lakeside path is fully accessible, making it possible for wheelchair users to enjoy the cultural trail. The stage begins in Bauen, where the gables of its traditional central Swiss farmhouses face towards the lake.  Lush gardens are home to palm trees, fig trees and other exotic plants. Narrow alleyways, terracing walls and small squares emphasise the Mediterranean panache, thanks to its lakeside location and frequent Foehn winds. Another special feature is that the village is vehicle-free and can only be reached via water by public transport. Following the lake shore, you leave Bauen in a southerly direction. The hillside is overgrown with dense forest and becomes so steep that the trail continues through the mountain. You will find yourself in cool rock galleries with stunning views of Lake Uri. Part of the route on long wooden footbridges along the shore also runs parallel with the road. Due to the danger of falling rocks, the final 400 metres of the path had to be closed and the hiking route was moved to the road tunnel. The lake calls to you in Isleten. This is located on the flat delta of the Isentalerbach stream and has attractive bathing sites. Isleten is also popular with surfers because of the favourable wind conditions. The Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, produced explosives here from 1873. These were mainly used in the construction of the Gotthard railway tunnel. You now continue on a superb gravel path along the shore in the direction of Fl\u00fcelen. A number of benches and fire pits invite you to linger. On the shore, the water of the lake sloshes relentlessly against dark boulders. Another highlight awaits you behind the lake resort in the municipality of Seedorf. In the Reuss Delta nature protection area, fens, reed meadows, islands, shallow water areas, watercourses and ditches offer valuable refuge for rare plants and more than 200 species of birds, insects, mussels and fish. However, bathers are catered for here too. You can lay out your beach towel on the three Lorelei islands, which were created using material excavated from the Gotthard Base Tunnel. After around two kilometres, the trail takes you right through the middle of the natural paradise. It is also worth going up the wooden lookout tower made of willow. You have a superb panoramic view of the lake, the mountains and the Reuss estuary from this architectural masterpiece by the Grisons architect Gion Caminada. From here it is just a stone\u2019s throw to Fl\u00fcelen, the destination for this stage. Rudenz Castle with its castle park that is open to the public, invites you to make a detour here.

The cantons gifted the Swiss Path to the population of Switzerland in 1991. The cantons of Schaffhausen, the two Appenzells and St. Gallen were allowed to design this section of the trail in the order in which they joined the Swiss Confederation.

The train sounds remind you of the presence of the important north-south axis from Zurich to Milan, which runs parallel to long stretches of the route. On the lake promenade, you can walk comfortably along the hillside between the tracks and water. A narrow wooden footbridge goes underneath the Sulzegg viaduct.

The path was built into and through the rock and it provides a vertical view downwards from the old Axenstrasse onto the rock face to the azure blue Lake Uri and the surrounding mountains. The narrow paths are well maintained, and incorporate disused railway sleepers that serve as steps. Huge rock arches and pillars support the mountain under which the hikers pass, and they give you an idea of the effort involved in building the old Axenstrasse.

The stage starts at the end of the virtually uninhabited Calfeisen valley with a splendid view over the valley floor and the Gigerwald lake. The first section of the route leads along the steep slope back to the Heub\u00fctzli pass. The trail climbs far above the tree line over alpine meadows, scree gullies, streams and past rock faces. With a bit of luck, you can observe a family of marmots. Once on the pass, you look down on the Heub\u00fctzli lake, situated in a scree hollow. A narrow, pointed, rocky ridge stretches out to the left and right. The trail now continues partly on the mountain ridge around the Fahnenstock and then down into the Muota valley. Here it is quite possible to be observed by ibexes (or vice versa). Their majestic silhouettes stand out impressively against the Muota valley ridge. Numerous rocks have tumbled onto the meadows from the steep slopes on both sides. The special formations of terrain and rocks are a witness to the forces of nature that have been at work here over millions of years. Upon arrival at the Foobach rushing through deeply cut rock hollows, the descent ends and the route heads uphill once more. Passing picturesque rock faces in the green countryside, the trail now heads towards the Foo pass. Above the Heidelbach stream, you will notice a great variety of flora. Once on top of the Foo pass, the view opens up over the massive mountain ranges of the Sernftal valley. Here you reach the highest point of the stage at 2,223 metres and begin a long descent down to Elm with its 1,041 metres above sea level. Initially, the trail is steep and zigzags across stony slopes to Raminer Matt. Later it continues down into the valley on firmer paths through the forest. Here, one\u2019s attention is drawn time and again to the impressive waterfalls tumbling from the cliffs on the opposite side of the slope. During the descent, the main Glarus overthrust between Ringelspitz and Piz Sardona becomes clearly visible. The distinct horizontal line in the mountain separates two layers of rock. The supporting lower layer is more than 200 million years younger than the darker layer above. Once at the bottom of the valley, the trail continues across the Sernf river to Elm. From here it is well worth taking a look back at the mountain scenery and the Martinsloch (Martin's hole). Twice a year, the sun shines through this drop-shaped opening to illuminate the church tower of Elm. The hole is said to have been cut into the rock in the battle between the heroic Martin and the evil giant. In the slate museum in Elm, you can learn more about slate mining which marked this valley, and the production site of Elmer Citro offers a first-hand experience of the springs. You can descend into the spring area and learn how mineral water is generated from rain and snow deep in the Glarus mountains over the course of eight years.",

Sainte-Croix in the Vaud Jura is easy to reach by narrow-gauge railway. In the 19th century, this was the global centre of music box production. Modern-day visitors can admire the historic collection at the Centre International de M\u00e9canique d\u2019Art (CIMA) on guided tours.

But first comes the hard work: the first section of about two kilometres runs along a main road, making the view of Lake Neuch\u00e2tel even more beautiful. After about an hour, hikers reach one of the most significant preserved medieval road systems in Switzerland. The longest cart track of its time can still be found in the dense beech forest on the steep descent. Thanks to the channels carved into the Jura limestone, the muleteers were able to drive their salt-laden ox carts over the steep terrain until the 19th century. In 2014, the historic salt road was turned into an educational trail. Information boards tell the story of this important traffic artery between France and Switzerland dating back to the 13th century. After the steep descent on a narrow forest path, the route runs on mostly flat terrain through the sweeping agricultural land of the Jura plain. From the village of Vuiteboeuf with 500 inhabitants where waggoners once changed their horses, it skirts the forest at the foot of the \u201cRapilles de Baulmes\u201d cliff. The sound of chirping birds now replaces the engine noise heard on the historic section near the road. After just under an hour, the trail reaches the little village of Baulmes. It leaves the Jura chain behind, crossing huge arable fields and passing by cattle herds and farms.

In the final part of the stage, hikers leave the wide trail at the hydroelectric power station in Montcherand and enter a dense forest traversed by narrow paths. Crossing the Orbe Gorge (Gorges de l\u2019Orbe) over a small suspension bridge is an impressive experience. After hiking along the little river Orbe for just under an hour, we reach the small medieval town of the same name.

Easily accessible by public transport, the path is signposted with brown-colored signs (Sentiero storico 1). From this village, which owes its name to its mineral-rich thermal waters, you can walk towards Corzoneso where you can visit the beautiful church dedicated to Saint Nazzaro and Saint Celso, embellished by stuccos and frescoes. Further along the trail, you will reach the hamlet of Casserio, where the Donetta Archives are housed in a round building, formerly home of photographer Roberto Donetta (1865-1932) who divided his time between his passion for photography and several run-of-the-mill jobs to support his large family. He worked as seeds pedlar and, in winter, as a \u201cmarronaio\u201d (chestnut seller), migrating, like his fellow villagers, to northern Italy. He lived and died in great poverty. His plates were only recovered recently and his photographs, of enormous historic value, are now on display in his \"Round House\".  (For opening hours visit  ). After leaving Corzoneso, continue onwards to Mount Navone (770 meters), an idyllic place where, amidst vast meadows, you will come across several interesting rustic buildings and a chapel dedicated to Santa Maria Bambina. This unique, octagonal, Baroque-style-building hosts several paintings depicting the life of the Virgin Mary. The trail then descends to Semione, through forests and meadows offering beautiful views over the villages in the valley below. With its bell tower, its churchyard hosting the chapels of the \u2018Via Crucis\u2019, an 18th century cross and the Chapel of the Deceased, the recently restored village church forms an architectural ensemble of great beauty and artistic value. In particular, standouts include the frescoes in the chapel, several of which are thought to have been painted by artists of the Seregnesi school (15th century). The village also boasts several picturesque houses built in the late 19th and early 20th century by emigrants who had returned to their homeland.  While walking along this historic path, make sure to stop and admire the ruins of the Serravalle Castle. Overlooking the rocky promontory, surrounded by lush green countryside, partially covered by vineyards, you will find the remains of several of its grey walls testifying the storied past of this stronghold. These are now object of study and restoration. The church of the castle, situated just a little lower down, houses 16th century frescoes by Giovanni Battista Tarilli Cureglia. Continue along the path and follow the signs leading to Ludiano, an area abounding in vineyards and grottoes boasting an ancient 18th century lever wine press. At this point, a stop at the grotto is an absolute must! A short detour will take you to the discovery of the beautiful San Pietro di Motto church. The Romanesque building dates from the 13th century and was expanded in the 16th century. Enter the woods to reach the chapel of Santa Maria del Monastero, also known as San Martino Viduale. The area once hosted a hospice for wayfarers who undertook the long journey, either travelling from north to south through the Lucomagno pass or arriving from the Nara pass. Legend has it that Martino Rossi, a native of Blenio, actually worked here, later going on to become the most famous chef of the Italian Quattrocento (namely the 15th century). Once back on the path, before returning to the starting point in Acquarossa, you will come across the charming Romanesque church of San Remigio (11th century), located in the hamlet of Boscero. The historic trail of Blenio Valley is an easy, 14 kilometer hike that will take about 5 hours to complete without stops. For the access keys to the religious buildings found along the way (generally closed), we recommend making enquiries at the tourist office in Olivone (tel. 091 872 14 87).\n                                ",

        "text": "Tibetan Bridge of Curz\u00fatt This four-hour walk in the hills along the right bank of the Ticino River, in the region facing the Magadino Plain, does not only offer a beautiful scenery, but also boasts several points of interest. The thrill of crossing one of the longest Tibetan bridges in Switzerland (270 metres); the discovery of the Romanesque church of San Bernardo, featuring a number of beautiful frescoes of 14th and 15th century; a visit to the old and beautifully restored housing cluster of Curz\u00fatt, testifying to the time when daily life mainly revolved around hillside activities.\n                                 \n                                 The hike begins in Sementina (Via alla Serta). After having passed through the door of the \"Fortini della fame\" (Hunger Towers), you follow a path that further joins \"Via delle Vigne\". At \"Mond\u00f2 you leave the trail among the vineyards and go up towards San Defendente.  This first part of the walk crosses through a striking hilly landscape carpeted with sun-drenched vineyards, which are cultivated by tree small vine-growers. All of them produce excellent wines.   Located on the beautiful upland of San Defendente is an old medieval oratory of the same name, boasting frescoes of the 16th century. From San Defendente the landscape changes: the vineyards are replaced by chestnut trees, which are to be found all along the trail. Getting closer to the Tibetan bridge, through the thick vegetation, you can catch sight of the  , the San Bernardo Church and Curz\u00fatt.  The Tibetan bridge appears almost at the end of the path, thin and elegant. Of breath-taking, scenic impact, the bridge measures 270 metres in length and is suspended 130 metres above the creek below. A walkway with 728 larch boards, a safety wire mesh on the sides, and a handrail make crossing it much easier and safer. For those who do not feel dizzy, the middle of the bridge is the right place to admire a beautiful panorama including the   Plain, the mountains and, in the distance, the Castles of Bellinzona. After passing the Tibetan bridge the path crosses a pretty arduous area before reaching the church of San Bernardo, a monument of national value. This small Romanesque church stands in a clearing in the woods. Though seemingly isolated, it was once an active part of village life. Its origins date back to the late 11th century. The interior is architecturally simple, but rich in 14th and 15th century frescoes covering virtually all of the walls. The painting of the Last Supper is especially interesting owing to the fact that the artist featured local products, including freshwater crabs and cherries, on the table. Should the little church be closed, you will find its keys a little further, in Curz\u00fatt, either at the hostel or at the restaurant.  The old cluster of Curz\u00fatt, situated at an altitude of 600 metres, lies just a short distance from the church and boasts a restaurant. In past centuries, people did not live on the Plains as they do today, but rather on the hills. This, not only because the Ticino River frequently overflowed, meaning that those living along its banks were at greater risk of contracting malaria, but also to avoid the raids of armies vying for Bellinzona, an important access route to the Alps. The beautiful housing cluster of Curz\u00fatt, with its stone buildings, gardens, and terraces planted with fields of grain and vineyards, has been beautifully restored by the Fondazione Curz\u00fatt-S. Barnard. The restoration was not intended to create an open-air museum, but rather a lively centre that now boasts a hostel and a top-level restaurant. Several buildings, stonewalls and the old mule path have been renovated with other on-site amenities including a delightful playground for children. After the visit of Curz\u00fatt the walk goes on descending to Monte Carasso, crossing through a hilly area carpeted with sun-drenched vineyards, and passing by the church of SS. Trinit\u00e0 and the curious cylindrical constructions named \"Fortini della fame\" (Hunger Towers). Another option is to descend by cable car from the intermediate station in Curz\u00fatt, but there is often a long waiting time. From spring to the end of October, there is a shuttle bus service with departure and arrival at the Infopoint in Monte Carasso. In the morning the bus takes you up to San Defendente's oratory: departure every 45 minutes between 9.15am and 0.45pm. In the afternoon, the shuttle bus bring you back to Monte Carasso: departure at the parking Pairolo under Curz\u00fatt. May and June, the shuttle bus is operating only Friday-Sunday and holidays; from July it operates daily, when the weather is good.

A stroll through their vineyards is strongly recommended and represents a truly enjoyable experience! However, these vineyards are very difficult to handle. Not only are they steep and difficult to access but, in recent years, there have been recurring raids by wild boars. It has been estimated that looking after these vineyards requires almost twice the amount of time needed for those found in the valley. However, their favourable position contributes to the quality of the grapes grown here, which is truly excellent. Constant exposure to sunshine and fresh mountain air means that the grapes ripen to produce several excellent cultivars. At Curz\u00fatt\u2019s restaurant-hostel you can taste the wines produced on site from grapes cultivated in the old restored vineyard (with vines obtained from hybrids of different species) .  In the village of Monte Carasso, just a short walk from the cable car station, don\u2019t miss a visit to the three wine producers of note: \"Cantina Settemaggio\" (by the Marcionetti family), \"Cantina Pizzorin\" (by Giancarlo Pestoni) and \"Cantina I Fracc\" (managed by Christian Rigozzi, brother of the famous, former Miss Switzerland).  In Sementina, where this excursion begins, you can visit the cellars \"Colli di Sementina\" and \"Azienda Mond\u00f2\".\n                                ",

For those who do not feel dizzy, the middle of the bridge is the right place to admire a beautiful panorama including the   Plain, the mountains and, in the distance, the Castles of Bellinzona. After passing the Tibetan bridge the path crosses a pretty arduous area before reaching the church of San Bernardo, a monument of national value. This small Romanesque church stands in a clearing in the woods. Though seemingly isolated, it was once an active part of village life. Its origins date back to the late 11th century. The interior is architecturally simple, but rich in 14th and 15th century frescoes covering virtually all of the walls. The painting of the Last Supper is especially interesting owing to the fact that the artist featured local products, including freshwater crabs and cherries, on the table. Should the little church be closed, you will find its keys a little further, in Curz\u00fatt, either at the hostel or at the restaurant.  The old cluster of Curz\u00fatt, situated at an altitude of 600 metres, lies just a short distance from the church and boasts a restaurant. In past centuries, people did not live on the Plains as they do today, but rather on the hills. This, not only because the Ticino River frequently overflowed, meaning that those living along its banks were at greater risk of contracting malaria, but also to avoid the raids of armies vying for Bellinzona, an important access route to the Alps. The beautiful housing cluster of Curz\u00fatt, with its stone buildings, gardens, and terraces planted with fields of grain and vineyards, has been beautifully restored by the Fondazione Curz\u00fatt-S. Barnard. The restoration was not intended to create an open-air museum, but rather a lively centre that now boasts a hostel and a top-level restaurant. Several buildings, stonewalls and the old mule path have been renovated with other on-site amenities including a delightful playground for children. After the visit of Curz\u00fatt the walk goes on descending to Monte Carasso, crossing through a hilly area carpeted with sun-drenched vineyards, and passing by the church of SS. Trinit\u00e0 and the curious cylindrical constructions named \"Fortini della fame\" (Hunger Towers). Another option is to descend by cable car from the intermediate station in Curz\u00fatt, but there is often a long waiting time. From spring to the end of October, there is a shuttle bus service with departure and arrival at the Infopoint in Monte Carasso. In the morning the bus takes you up to San Defendente's oratory: departure every 45 minutes between 9.15am and 0.45pm. In the afternoon, the shuttle bus bring you back to Monte Carasso: departure at the parking Pairolo under Curz\u00fatt. May and June, the shuttle bus is operating only Friday-Sunday and holidays; from July it operates daily, when the weather is good. Ticket office for both the shuttle bus and the cable car at the Infopoint in Monte Carasso. Info, timetables, prices: Infopoint Monte Carasso, via El Cunv\u00e9nt 3 - tel. +41 (0)58 203 14 50  -  carasc@bellinzona.ch For   lovers the hilly area, lying on the right bank of the Ticino River, offers some of the most interesting wineries in the Canton. A stroll through their vineyards is strongly recommended and represents a truly enjoyable experience! However, these vineyards are very difficult to handle. Not only are they steep and difficult to access but, in recent years, there have been recurring raids by wild boars. It has been estimated that looking after these vineyards requires almost twice the amount of time needed for those found in the valley. However, their favourable position contributes to the quality of the grapes grown here, which is truly excellent. Constant exposure to sunshine and fresh mountain air means that the grapes ripen to produce several excellent cultivars. At Curz\u00fatt\u2019s restaurant-hostel you can taste the wines produced on site from grapes cultivated in the old restored vineyard (with vines obtained from hybrids of different species) .  In the village of Monte Carasso, just a short walk from the cable car station, don\u2019t miss a visit to the three wine producers of note: \"Cantina Settemaggio\" (by the Marcionetti family), \"Cantina Pizzorin\" (by Giancarlo Pestoni) and \"Cantina I Fracc\" (managed by Christian Rigozzi, brother of the famous, former Miss Switzerland).  In Sementina, where this excursion begins, you can visit the cellars \"Colli di Sementina\" and \"Azienda Mond\u00f2\".\n                                ",

The thrill of crossing one of the longest Tibetan bridges in Switzerland (270 metres); the discovery of the Romanesque church of San Bernardo, featuring a number of beautiful frescoes of 14th and 15th century; a visit to the old and beautifully restored housing cluster of Curz\u00fatt, testifying to the time when daily life mainly revolved around hillside activities.\n                                 \n                                 The hike begins in Sementina (Via alla Serta). After having passed through the door of the \"Fortini della fame\" (Hunger Towers), you follow a path that further joins \"Via delle Vigne\". At \"Mond\u00f2 you leave the trail among the vineyards and go up towards San Defendente.  This first part of the walk crosses through a striking hilly landscape carpeted with sun-drenched vineyards, which are cultivated by tree small vine-growers. All of them produce excellent wines.   Located on the beautiful upland of San Defendente is an old medieval oratory of the same name, boasting frescoes of the 16th century. From San Defendente the landscape changes: the vineyards are replaced by chestnut trees, which are to be found all along the trail. Getting closer to the Tibetan bridge, through the thick vegetation, you can catch sight of the  , the San Bernardo Church and Curz\u00fatt.

History of the Simplon in the old army barracks and Stockalperturm in Gondo. Die Etappe beginnt beim Hotel Post in Simplon Dorf, von wo aus Brig und Domodossola je 31 Kilometer entfernt sind. Dank seinen sch\u00f6nen Steinh\u00e4usern hat der Ort einen mediterranen Charakter. Wer mehr \u00fcber die Geschichte der Region und des Naturraums erfahren m\u00f6chte, kann im Ecomuseum mit seinen Holzdecken und dicken Mauern in die Vergangenheit eintauchen. Durch enge Gassen wird die Ortschaft verlassen und dem Saumpfad sowie der Schlucht des Chrummbachs folgend beginnt der sanfte Abstieg nach Gondo im Osten. Gewaltige bewaldete H\u00e4nge erheben sich zu allen Seiten.  Nach der \u00dcberquerung weiter Matten beginnt der steile Abstieg im Wald auf sch\u00f6nen Steinstufen. Unten m\u00fcndet der Chrummbach in die Doveria und nun steigt der alte Saumpfad auf der anderen Seite des Sattels hinunter ins romantische Zwischbergental nach Gondo. Vorbei an ehemaligen Goldminen geht es am Nordhang weiter auf die felsige Gondoschlucht zu.  Durch den Wald \u00fcber der Doveria und der Strasse wandert man weiter talw\u00e4rts unter imposanten Felsw\u00e4nden. Flache, glatte Wegplatten aus Stein schl\u00e4ngeln sich zwischen gewaltigen Felsbrocken hindurch. In der Gondoschlucht s\u00e4umen senkrecht aufragende Felsw\u00e4nde den Weg. Ein Teil der Wegstrecke f\u00fchrt im Schutz der gedeckten Strasse unter verschiedenen Wasserl\u00e4ufen hindurch, die neben dem Weg in die Tiefe fallen. Teilweise ist man auf dem Saumpfad von Kaspar Stockalper unterwegs oder auf der Napoleonstrasse. Immer wieder begegnet man Br\u00fccken und Mauerpfeilern dieses Wunderwerks des franz\u00f6sischen Strassenbaus. Die Nationalstrasse ist der neuste Verkehrsweg, der sich neben den bestehenden Platz machen musste.  Sowohl die napoleonische Alte Kaserne als auch das Fort Gondo aus dem Ersten Weltkrieg sind Zeugnisse der strategischen Bedeutung der Schlucht. Die Alte Kaserne ist durch einen metallenen Steg \u00fcber die Doveria mit dem Stockalperweg verbunden und dient heute als Rastplatz der Nationalstrasse. Zur Festung des Fort Gondo geh\u00f6rt ein gut 350 Meter langer Stollen, durch den die Wanderung hindurchf\u00fchrt. Am Ende der Schlucht und gleichzeitig am Ausgang des Zwischbergentals liegt das Grenzdorf Gondo. Das Dorf wird vom Stockalperturm dominiert. Ein Bergsturz forderte in Gondo am 14. Oktober 2000 dreizehn Menschenleben und zerst\u00f6rte zahlreiche Geb\u00e4ude. Heute beherbergt der Turm ein Seminarhotel und eine Ausstellung \u00fcber die Goldminen im Tal. Die Via Stockalper endet hier in Gondo. Der Weg f\u00fchrt jedoch auf zwei weiteren Etappen weiter nach Domodossola. L\u2019\u00e9tape commence \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4tel Post du village de Simplon, d\u2019o\u00f9 Brigue et Domodossola sont \u00e0 \u00e9gale distance de 31 kilom\u00e8tres. Les maisons en pierre donnent \u00e0 ce village un charme tout m\u00e9diterran\u00e9en. Celles et ceux qui voudront en savoir plus sur l\u2019histoire de la r\u00e9gion et l\u2019espace naturel pourront plonger dans le pass\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9comus\u00e9e avec ses plafonds en bois et ses murs \u00e9pais. On quitte le village par des ruelles \u00e9troites et on commence la descente en pente douce vers Gondo \u00e0 l\u2019est en suivant le sentier muletier et les gorges du Chrummbach. D\u2019immenses pentes bois\u00e9es se dressent de tous les c\u00f4t\u00e9s. Apr\u00e8s avoir travers\u00e9 de vastes prairies, on s\u2019attaque \u00e0 la descente raide dans la for\u00eat sur de belles marches en pierre. En bas, le Chrummbach se jette dans la Doveria et de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 du col, l\u2019ancien sentier muletier descend dans la romantique vall\u00e9e de Zwischbergental vers Gondo. En passant devant d\u2019anciennes mines d\u2019or, le sentier continue sur le versant nord en direction des gorges rocheuses de Gondo. \u00c0 travers la for\u00eat au-dessus de la Doveria et le long de la route, on continue \u00e0 descendre sous d\u2019imposantes parois rocheuses. Des dalles de pierre plates et lisses se faufilent entre d\u2019\u00e9normes blocs de rocher. Dans les gorges de Gondo, des parois rocheuses verticales bordent le chemin. Une partie du chemin se fait \u00e0 l\u2019abri de la route couverte sous diff\u00e9rents cours d\u2019eau qui se pr\u00e9cipitent dans les profondeurs \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du chemin. L\u2019itin\u00e9raire emprunte en partie le sentier muletier de Kaspar Stockalper ou la route Napol\u00e9on. On tombe r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement sur des ponts et des piliers muraux de cette merveille de la construction routi\u00e8re fran\u00e7aise. La route nationale est la voie de communication la plus r\u00e9cente, qui a d\u00fb se faire une place \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de celles qui existaient d\u00e9j\u00e0. Tant l\u2019ancienne caserne napol\u00e9onienne que le Fort Gondo datant de la Premi\u00e8re Guerre mondiale t\u00e9moignent de l\u2019importance strat\u00e9gique des gorges. L\u2019ancienne caserne est reli\u00e9e au \u00abStockalperweg\u00bb par une passerelle m\u00e9tallique qui enjambe la Doveria et sert aujourd\u2019hui d\u2019aire de repos \u00e0 la route nationale. Une galerie d\u2019un peu plus de 350 m\u00e8tres de long fait partie du Fort Gondo, par laquelle passe la randonn\u00e9e. Le village frontalier de Gondo se trouve au bout des gorges et en m\u00eame temps \u00e0 la sortie de la vall\u00e9e de Zwischenbergental. Le village est domin\u00e9 par la tour Stockalper.  Un glissement de terrain a fait treize morts \u00e0 Gondo le 14 octobre 2000 et emport\u00e9 de nombreuses maisons. Aujourd\u2019hui, la tour abrite un h\u00f4tel pour s\u00e9minaires et une exposition sur les mines d\u2019or de la vall\u00e9e. La Via Stockalper se termine ici, \u00e0 Gondo. L\u2019itin\u00e9raire se poursuit toutefois en deux autres \u00e9tapes jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Domodossola. La tappa inizia a Simplon Dorf, presso l\u2019Hotel Post, da cui Briga e Domodossola distano rispettivamente 31 chilometri. Grazie alle sue belle case in pietra, questo luogo ha un carattere mediterraneo. Chi desidera conoscere meglio la storia della regione e l\u2019ambiente naturale in cui si sviluppa, pu\u00f2 immergersi nel passato visitando l\u2019Ecomuseo con i suoi soffitti in legno e i suoi muri spessi. Si lascia quindi il villaggio percorrendone stretti vicoli e, seguendo la mulattiera e la gola del Chrummbach, si inizia la dolce discesa verso Gondo in direzione est. Imponenti pendii boscosi si ergono tutt\u2019intorno.  Dopo aver attraversato ampi prati, inizia la ripida discesa nel bosco su bellissimi gradini di pietra. Pi\u00f9 in basso il Chrummbach si getta nel Doveria e ora la vecchia mulattiera risale dall\u2019altra parte della sella nella romantica Zwischbergental (Val Vaira in italiano) fino a Gondo. Passando ex miniere d\u2019oro, si prosegue sul versante settentrionale verso la rocciosa gola di Gondo.  Attraverso il bosco sopra il Doveria e la strada si procede verso valle sovrastati da imponenti pareti rocciose. Il sentiero di lastre in pietra piatte e levigate si intreccia con grandi massi mentre nella gola di Gondo costeggia imponenti pareti rocciose verticali. Una parte del percorso, al riparo della strada coperta, conduce sotto diversi corsi d\u2019acqua che scendono in profondit\u00e0 a ridosso del sentiero. Un\u2019altra parte si svolge sulla mulattiera di Kaspar Stockalper o sulla strada napoleonica. I ponti e i contrafforti di questa meraviglia dell\u2019ingegneria stradale francese sono una costante di questa escursione. La strada nazionale \u00e8 la via di comunicazione pi\u00f9 recente, progettata a supporto di quelle esistenti.  La vecchia caserma napoleonica e il Fort Gondo \u2013 risalente alla prima guerra mondiale \u2013 testimoniano l\u2019importanza strategica della gola. La vecchia caserma \u00e8 collegata alla Via Stockalper da una passerella metallica che attraversa il Doveria e funge oggi da area di sosta per la strada nazionale. Il Fort Gondo comprende una galleria lunga 350 metri in cui prosegue l\u2019escursione. Alla fine della gola, in coincidenza con l\u2019uscita dalla Val Vaira, ecco apparire il villaggio di confine Gondo, dominato dalla Torre Stockalper. In questa localit\u00e0, la frana del 14 ottobre 2000 caus\u00f2 tredici vittime e distrusse numerosi edifici. Oggi la torre ospita un hotel per conferenze e una mostra sulle miniere d\u2019oro della valle. La Via Stockalper termina qui a Gondo ma il percorso prosegue con altre due tappe fino a Domodossola. The stage starts at the Hotel Post in the village of Simplon, which is located at 31 kilometres from both Brig and Domodossola. Thanks to its lovely stone houses, the village has a somewhat Mediterranean character. Those who want to learn more about the history of the region and the natural surroundings can delve into the past at the Ecomuseum with its wooden ceilings and massive walls. You leave the village through narrow alleys and follow the mule track and the gorge of the Chrummbach to start the gentle descent to Gondo in the east. Enormous wooded slopes rise up on all sides. After crossing extensive pastures, there\u2019s a steep descent through the forest along nice stone steps. At the bottom, the Chrummbach stream flows into the Doveria, and the old mule track descends on the other side of the crest into the romantic Zwischbergen valley to Gondo. Past former gold mines, the trail continues along the northern slope towards the rocky Gondo gorge.   Through the forest above the Doveria stream and the road, you hike further down into the valley underneath impressive rock faces. A trail made of flat, smooth slabs of stone winds its way between huge boulders. In the Gondo gorge, vertical rock faces line the path. Protected by the covered road, part of the trail passes beneath various watercourses which drop into the depths beside the path. Some of the trail follows the mule track of Kaspar Stockalper or the Napoleon road. Time and again you come across bridges and masonry pillars of this masterpiece of French road construction. The national road is the latest traffic route, and it had to conquer its place next to the existing ones. Both the Napoleonic old barracks and the Gondo fort from the First World War are testimonies to the strategic importance of the gorge. The old barracks is linked to the Stockalperweg by a metal footbridge over the Doveria stream and today serves as a rest area for the national road. The Gondo fort includes a tunnel which is some 350 metres long and which the hike passes through. The border village of Gondo is situated at the end of the gorge and at the same time at the exit of the Zwischbergen valley. The village is dominated by the Stockalper tower. On 14 October 2000, a landslide claimed thirteen lives in Gondo and destroyed numerous buildings. Today, the tower is home to a seminar hotel and an exhibition about the valley\u2019s gold mines. Here, the Via Stockalper ends. However, the route continues on two more stages to Domodossola.",

Une partie du chemin se fait \u00e0 l\u2019abri de la route couverte sous diff\u00e9rents cours d\u2019eau qui se pr\u00e9cipitent dans les profondeurs \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du chemin. L\u2019itin\u00e9raire emprunte en partie le sentier muletier de Kaspar Stockalper ou la route Napol\u00e9on. On tombe r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement sur des ponts et des piliers muraux de cette merveille de la construction routi\u00e8re fran\u00e7aise. La route nationale est la voie de communication la plus r\u00e9cente, qui a d\u00fb se faire une place \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de celles qui existaient d\u00e9j\u00e0. Tant l\u2019ancienne caserne napol\u00e9onienne que le Fort Gondo datant de la Premi\u00e8re Guerre mondiale t\u00e9moignent de l\u2019importance strat\u00e9gique des gorges. L\u2019ancienne caserne est reli\u00e9e au \u00abStockalperweg\u00bb par une passerelle m\u00e9tallique qui enjambe la Doveria et sert aujourd\u2019hui d\u2019aire de repos \u00e0 la route nationale. Une galerie d\u2019un peu plus de 350 m\u00e8tres de long fait partie du Fort Gondo, par laquelle passe la randonn\u00e9e. Le village frontalier de Gondo se trouve au bout des gorges et en m\u00eame temps \u00e0 la sortie de la vall\u00e9e de Zwischenbergental. Le village est domin\u00e9 par la tour Stockalper.  Un glissement de terrain a fait treize morts \u00e0 Gondo le 14 octobre 2000 et emport\u00e9 de nombreuses maisons. Aujourd\u2019hui, la tour abrite un h\u00f4tel pour s\u00e9minaires et une exposition sur les mines d\u2019or de la vall\u00e9e. La Via Stockalper se termine ici, \u00e0 Gondo. L\u2019itin\u00e9raire se poursuit toutefois en deux autres \u00e9tapes jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Domodossola. La tappa inizia a Simplon Dorf, presso l\u2019Hotel Post, da cui Briga e Domodossola distano rispettivamente 31 chilometri. Grazie alle sue belle case in pietra, questo luogo ha un carattere mediterraneo. Chi desidera conoscere meglio la storia della regione e l\u2019ambiente naturale in cui si sviluppa, pu\u00f2 immergersi nel passato visitando l\u2019Ecomuseo con i suoi soffitti in legno e i suoi muri spessi. Si lascia quindi il villaggio percorrendone stretti vicoli e, seguendo la mulattiera e la gola del Chrummbach, si inizia la dolce discesa verso Gondo in direzione est. Imponenti pendii boscosi si ergono tutt\u2019intorno.  Dopo aver attraversato ampi prati, inizia la ripida discesa nel bosco su bellissimi gradini di pietra. Pi\u00f9 in basso il Chrummbach si getta nel Doveria e ora la vecchia mulattiera risale dall\u2019altra parte della sella nella romantica Zwischbergental (Val Vaira in italiano) fino a Gondo. Passando ex miniere d\u2019oro, si prosegue sul versante settentrionale verso la rocciosa gola di Gondo.  Attraverso il bosco sopra il Doveria e la strada si procede verso valle sovrastati da imponenti pareti rocciose. Il sentiero di lastre in pietra piatte e levigate si intreccia con grandi massi mentre nella gola di Gondo costeggia imponenti pareti rocciose verticali. Una parte del percorso, al riparo della strada coperta, conduce sotto diversi corsi d\u2019acqua che scendono in profondit\u00e0 a ridosso del sentiero. Un\u2019altra parte si svolge sulla mulattiera di Kaspar Stockalper o sulla strada napoleonica. I ponti e i contrafforti di questa meraviglia dell\u2019ingegneria stradale francese sono una costante di questa escursione. La strada nazionale \u00e8 la via di comunicazione pi\u00f9 recente, progettata a supporto di quelle esistenti.  La vecchia caserma napoleonica e il Fort Gondo \u2013 risalente alla prima guerra mondiale \u2013 testimoniano l\u2019importanza strategica della gola. La vecchia caserma \u00e8 collegata alla Via Stockalper da una passerella metallica che attraversa il Doveria e funge oggi da area di sosta per la strada nazionale. Il Fort Gondo comprende una galleria lunga 350 metri in cui prosegue l\u2019escursione. Alla fine della gola, in coincidenza con l\u2019uscita dalla Val Vaira, ecco apparire il villaggio di confine Gondo, dominato dalla Torre Stockalper. In questa localit\u00e0, la frana del 14 ottobre 2000 caus\u00f2 tredici vittime e distrusse numerosi edifici. Oggi la torre ospita un hotel per conferenze e una mostra sulle miniere d\u2019oro della valle. La Via Stockalper termina qui a Gondo ma il percorso prosegue con altre due tappe fino a Domodossola. The stage starts at the Hotel Post in the village of Simplon, which is located at 31 kilometres from both Brig and Domodossola. Thanks to its lovely stone houses, the village has a somewhat Mediterranean character. Those who want to learn more about the history of the region and the natural surroundings can delve into the past at the Ecomuseum with its wooden ceilings and massive walls. You leave the village through narrow alleys and follow the mule track and the gorge of the Chrummbach to start the gentle descent to Gondo in the east. Enormous wooded slopes rise up on all sides. After crossing extensive pastures, there\u2019s a steep descent through the forest along nice stone steps. At the bottom, the Chrummbach stream flows into the Doveria, and the old mule track descends on the other side of the crest into the romantic Zwischbergen valley to Gondo. Past former gold mines, the trail continues along the northern slope towards the rocky Gondo gorge.   Through the forest above the Doveria stream and the road, you hike further down into the valley underneath impressive rock faces. A trail made of flat, smooth slabs of stone winds its way between huge boulders. In the Gondo gorge, vertical rock faces line the path. Protected by the covered road, part of the trail passes beneath various watercourses which drop into the depths beside the path. Some of the trail follows the mule track of Kaspar Stockalper or the Napoleon road. Time and again you come across bridges and masonry pillars of this masterpiece of French road construction. The national road is the latest traffic route, and it had to conquer its place next to the existing ones. Both the Napoleonic old barracks and the Gondo fort from the First World War are testimonies to the strategic importance of the gorge. The old barracks is linked to the Stockalperweg by a metal footbridge over the Doveria stream and today serves as a rest area for the national road. The Gondo fort includes a tunnel which is some 350 metres long and which the hike passes through. The border village of Gondo is situated at the end of the gorge and at the same time at the exit of the Zwischbergen valley. The village is dominated by the Stockalper tower. On 14 October 2000, a landslide claimed thirteen lives in Gondo and destroyed numerous buildings. Today, the tower is home to a seminar hotel and an exhibition about the valley\u2019s gold mines. Here, the Via Stockalper ends. However, the route continues on two more stages to Domodossola."

Apr\u00e8s la descente \u00e0 la Singine, on traverse le dernier pont en bois couvert de la ville. Le pont de Berne a \u00e9t\u00e9 sci\u00e9 lors d\u2019une attaque des Bernois en 1340 afin de couper la route \u00e0 l\u2019ennemi.

Apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 la tour, on rejoint entre la for\u00eat et la zone d\u2019habitation l\u2019\u00e9glise Notre-Dame de Bourguillon. L\u2019endroit est tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 des p\u00e8lerins et \u00e9tait au Moyen \u00c2ge un lieu de refuge pour les personnes atteintes de la l\u00e8pre.

Peu avant la fin de l\u2019\u00e9tape, on atteint la fronti\u00e8re du Parc naturel de Gantrisch, o\u00f9, en plus de la d\u00e9couverte de la nature, on promeut \u00e9galement la biodiversit\u00e9 et l\u2019obscurit\u00e9 naturelle. Arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 Plaffeien, le regard est attir\u00e9 par la plus grande \u00e9glise n\u00e9o-romane du canton. Cette localit\u00e9 anim\u00e9e est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme le centre \u00e9conomique de l\u2019Oberland singinois. Friburgo \u00e8 una citt\u00e0 universitaria medievale bilingue con undici fontane storiche, oltre 200 facciate gotiche e molto fascino. La cattedrale, con le sue bellissime vetrate e la torre panoramica alta 74 metri, \u00e8 particolarmente suggestiva. Una volta saliti i 365 scalini, si gode di una splendida vista su tutta la citt\u00e0 e sulle Prealpi friburghesi. Queste ultime si estendono oltre il confine linguistico tedesco-francese nei cantoni di Friburgo, Berna e Vaud. Il paesaggio \u00e8 variegato e presenta montagne, laghi, riserve naturali e paesaggi plasmati dai ghiacciai.  La tappa inizia alla stazione ferroviaria di Friburgo e si snoda dapprima attraverso le strette vie del centro storico fino alla cattedrale. Dopo la discesa verso il fiume Sense, si attraversa l'ultimo ponte di legno coperto della citt\u00e0. Il ponte di Berna fu fatto a pezzi durante un attacco dei bernesi nel 1340 per bloccare la strada al nemico. Segue ora la salita accanto alle gole del Gott\u00e9ron e lungo le pareti rocciose fino alla torre rettangolare di D\u00fcrrenbuhl. Superata la torre, procedendo tra il bosco e l'abitato, si raggiunge la chiesa di Notre Dame de Bourguillon. Questo luogo \u00e8 molto amato dai pellegrini e nel Medioevo era un rifugio per i malati di lebbra. Uno splendido sentiero attraversa i pascoli e le foreste della regione collinare di Sense fino a St. Ursen.  L'escursione prosegue su un altopiano panoramico fino a Rechthalten. La chiesa parrocchiale locale di St. German bruci\u00f2 dopo essere stata colpita da un fulmine e fu nuovamente consacrata nel 1768. Poco dopo, nel 1784, il suo tetto in scandole di legno fu colpito da un proiettile, dopodich\u00e9 mezza chiesa fu nuovamente bruciata. Le torbiere in quota di Entemoos e Rotmoos fanno parte di questo comune. Anticamente, da queste due riserve naturali si estraeva la torba. Seguendo stretti sentieri e scale si raggiunge il punto pi\u00f9 elevato del percorso, la cappella Buechench\u00e4ppeli. Si prosegue lungo strade sterrate e asfaltate fino a Plaffeien. Le splendide Alpi sono una costante di questo paesaggio. Poco prima della fine della tappa, si raggiunge il confine con il Parco naturale del Gantrisch, dove oltre alle esperienze naturalistiche si promuovono la biodiversit\u00e0 e il buio. Una volta giunti a Plaffeien, salta all'occhio la pi\u00f9 grande chiesa neoromanica del cantone. Questa vivace localit\u00e0 \u00e8 considerata il centro economico dell'altopiano della regione di Sense. Fribourg is a bilingual medieval university town with eleven historic fountains, over 200 Gothic facades and plenty of charm. The cathedral, with its beautiful glass windows and the 74-metre-high viewing tower, is awe-inspiring. Once you have climbed the 365 steps, lovely views over the entire city and the Fribourg Pre-Alps beckon. They stretch across the German-French language border in the cantons of Fribourg, Bern and Vaud. The countryside is stunning and diverse, with its mountains, lakes, nature reserves, and primaeval landscapes created by glaciers.  The stage begins at Fribourg railway station and initially leads through the narrow alleyways of the historic old town to the cathedral. After descending to the Sense, you cross the last covered wooden bridge in the city. The Bern Bridge was sawn up during an attack by the Bernese in 1340 to cut off the enemy's way. Now comes the ascent beside the Gott\u00e9ron gorge and along rock faces up to the rectangular D\u00fcrrenbuhl tower. Passing the tower, you reach the Notre Dame de Bourguillon church between the forest and settlement area. The place is popular with pilgrims and was a refuge for people suffering from leprosy in the Middle Ages. A beautiful path follows through pasture and forest sections in the hilly landscape of the Senseland to St. Ursen.  Over a plateau with superb views, the hike continues to Rechthalten. The local parish church of St. German burnt down after being struck by lightning and was consecrated again in 1768. As early as 1784, its wooden shingle roof was hit by a bullet, after which half the church burnt down again. The Entemoos and Rotmoos upland moors are part of the municipality. Peat used to be cut from the two nature reserves. The route's highest point, the Buechench\u00e4ppeli, is reached via narrow paths and stairs. Continue on gravel and asphalt roads to Plaffeien. The magnificent Alps are always in sight. Shortly before the end of the stage, you reach the border to the Gantrisch Nature Park, where biodiversity and darkness are promoted in addition to nature experiences. Arriving in Plaffeien, the largest neo-Romanesque church in the canton catches the eye. The lively town is considered the economic centre of the Sense Oberland.",

La cattedrale, con le sue bellissime vetrate e la torre panoramica alta 74 metri, \u00e8 particolarmente suggestiva. Una volta saliti i 365 scalini, si gode di una splendida vista su tutta la citt\u00e0 e sulle Prealpi friburghesi. Queste ultime si estendono oltre il confine linguistico tedesco-francese nei cantoni di Friburgo, Berna e Vaud. Il paesaggio \u00e8 variegato e presenta montagne, laghi, riserve naturali e paesaggi plasmati dai ghiacciai.  La tappa inizia alla stazione ferroviaria di Friburgo e si snoda dapprima attraverso le strette vie del centro storico fino alla cattedrale. Dopo la discesa verso il fiume Sense, si attraversa l'ultimo ponte di legno coperto della citt\u00e0. Il ponte di Berna fu fatto a pezzi durante un attacco dei bernesi nel 1340 per bloccare la strada al nemico. Segue ora la salita accanto alle gole del Gott\u00e9ron e lungo le pareti rocciose fino alla torre rettangolare di D\u00fcrrenbuhl. Superata la torre, procedendo tra il bosco e l'abitato, si raggiunge la chiesa di Notre Dame de Bourguillon. Questo luogo \u00e8 molto amato dai pellegrini e nel Medioevo era un rifugio per i malati di lebbra. Uno splendido sentiero attraversa i pascoli e le foreste della regione collinare di Sense fino a St. Ursen.  L'escursione prosegue su un altopiano panoramico fino a Rechthalten. La chiesa parrocchiale locale di St. German bruci\u00f2 dopo essere stata colpita da un fulmine e fu nuovamente consacrata nel 1768. Poco dopo, nel 1784, il suo tetto in scandole di legno fu colpito da un proiettile, dopodich\u00e9 mezza chiesa fu nuovamente bruciata. Le torbiere in quota di Entemoos e Rotmoos fanno parte di questo comune. Anticamente, da queste due riserve naturali si estraeva la torba. Seguendo stretti sentieri e scale si raggiunge il punto pi\u00f9 elevato del percorso, la cappella Buechench\u00e4ppeli. Si prosegue lungo strade sterrate e asfaltate fino a Plaffeien. Le splendide Alpi sono una costante di questo paesaggio. Poco prima della fine della tappa, si raggiunge il confine con il Parco naturale del Gantrisch, dove oltre alle esperienze naturalistiche si promuovono la biodiversit\u00e0 e il buio. Una volta giunti a Plaffeien, salta all'occhio la pi\u00f9 grande chiesa neoromanica del cantone. Questa vivace localit\u00e0 \u00e8 considerata il centro economico dell'altopiano della regione di Sense. Fribourg is a bilingual medieval university town with eleven historic fountains, over 200 Gothic facades and plenty of charm. The cathedral, with its beautiful glass windows and the 74-metre-high viewing tower, is awe-inspiring. Once you have climbed the 365 steps, lovely views over the entire city and the Fribourg Pre-Alps beckon. They stretch across the German-French language border in the cantons of Fribourg, Bern and Vaud. The countryside is stunning and diverse, with its mountains, lakes, nature reserves, and primaeval landscapes created by glaciers.  The stage begins at Fribourg railway station and initially leads through the narrow alleyways of the historic old town to the cathedral. After descending to the Sense, you cross the last covered wooden bridge in the city. The Bern Bridge was sawn up during an attack by the Bernese in 1340 to cut off the enemy's way. Now comes the ascent beside the Gott\u00e9ron gorge and along rock faces up to the rectangular D\u00fcrrenbuhl tower. Passing the tower, you reach the Notre Dame de Bourguillon church between the forest and settlement area. The place is popular with pilgrims and was a refuge for people suffering from leprosy in the Middle Ages. A beautiful path follows through pasture and forest sections in the hilly landscape of the Senseland to St. Ursen.  Over a plateau with superb views, the hike continues to Rechthalten. The local parish church of St. German burnt down after being struck by lightning and was consecrated again in 1768. As early as 1784, its wooden shingle roof was hit by a bullet, after which half the church burnt down again. The Entemoos and Rotmoos upland moors are part of the municipality. Peat used to be cut from the two nature reserves. The route's highest point, the Buechench\u00e4ppeli, is reached via narrow paths and stairs. Continue on gravel and asphalt roads to Plaffeien. The magnificent Alps are always in sight. Shortly before the end of the stage, you reach the border to the Gantrisch Nature Park, where biodiversity and darkness are promoted in addition to nature experiences. Arriving in Plaffeien, the largest neo-Romanesque church in the canton catches the eye. The lively town is considered the economic centre of the Sense Oberland."
