The most widespread vine in the Italian part of Switzerland (82%) is precisely that same Merlot that distinguishes the production of Bordeaux, and that today is also made into whites with excellent results. To understand the relationship Merlot has to Ticino, we suggest an itinerary that takes you to the places where the first stumps of this variety were planted over a century ago and a visit to the \"Corte del vino\" which stocks 200 Ticino vintages.\n                                 \n                                The Ticino grape, that generally ripens at the end of September, gives the wine an intense and sharp ruby red tinge with a balanced body and pronounced character perfect for maturation in small oak barrels. Ticino presents two distinct types of terrain that geographically correspond to the South and the North of the canton and which distinguish the wines produced. According to the terroir of origin and to the wine-making methodology employed, the Ticino Merlots can accompany main courses with rich and flavorful sauces, grilled, roasted or braised red meats, game and excellent   produced in the numerous regional mountain pastures. The introduction of the Merlot wine in Ticino dates back to approximately a century ago. Its farming, that gradually superseded native varieties, was strongly promoted by the government after the Ticino vineyards were destroyed, like those of most of Europe, by the grape phylloxera, a disease originating in America. In Ticino the wines produced with the Merlot grape took a long time to assert themselves. Some wine cooperatives and some firms started to promote this production towards the end of the 1900s. It was especially the Matasci company from Tenero to introduce the Ticino Merlot North of the Alps, with its   still very popular today. However, Ticino's oenological revolution dates back to the '80s and is connected to a group of Swiss-German intellectuals with an academic background, that chose Ticino as their adoptive homeland attracted by the climate and the Latin culture. It was this group, lead by Christian Z\u00fcndel, Daniel Huber, Werner Stucky and Adrian Kaufmann, that innovated the canton's oenological world and proposed wines influenced by the Bordeaux tradition. Simultaneously, some \"fathers\" of Ticino's modern oenology - Fabio Arnaboldi, Luigi Zanini, Cesare Valsangiacomo, Claudio Tamborini and Sergio Monti - also followed the same direction and went to study at the University of Bordeaux. Today a growing number of youth, after having studied oenology, choose to return to Ticino to setup a winemaking business with their own grapes. Stimulated by about ten important cellars that produce excellent wines, the Swiss-Italian wine-making business has yet to face a crisis. It\u2019s currently thriving, having taken the right course by choosing quality over everything. Tightly bound to wine production, also that of spirits is a blooming activity in Ticino. Highly appreciated are the grappa (especially the one from American grapes), obtained through the distillation of marc after the pressing, and brandy, resulting from the distillation of pressed and fermented grape. A specialty typical of this region is the so-called \u201c \u201d (literally meaning \u201clittle nut\u201d), a very fragrant liquor obtained by putting nuts to macerate into the grappa when they are still green, with the addition of sugar and spices.  About forty one cellars, representing 90% of the canton\u2019s production, offer 250 different Ticino vintages at the \"Corte del Vino\" (house of wine), an establishment inaugurated in March 2017, in the romantic spaces of the 17th-century Mulino del Ghitello in Morbio Inferiore (Chiasso motorway exit). Dedicated to promoting the very best Ticino wines, this location represents all of Ticino\u2019s finest wineries. Its expert staff are always on-hand to offer visitors assistance and help them discover the multiple facets of Ticino wines. Tastings are accompanied by a selection of gastronomic products that typify the excellence of Ticino\u2019s local offerings.  Opening Time: Wednesday - Sunday. Spread over the whole territory, there are several marked walks that cross the Ticino vineyards. We have chosen to present a \"historic\" walk in Malcantone, where the cultivation of Merlot began, and another one in the Mendrisiotto, the region with the greatest density of vineyards. The proposed itinerary retraces the greatest periods of the history of Merlot in Ticino. Named the   (Human traces), the course unravels around Castelrotto, a region with a strong wine-making culture. It was here, at the beginning of the 1900s, that Giovanni Rossi first performed experiments with the Merlot variety after the phylloxera epidemic wiped out the canton's vineyards the previous century. Today, the multiple award-winning Tamborini wine cellar opened a B&B with a restaurant and wine-tasting/sales point. The walk goes by the commune of Beride, where two pioneers of the Ticino wine renaissance of the1980s, Christian Z\u00fcndel and Adriano Kaufmann, make wine. The circular itinerary starts from the L\u00fcsc school, where you may park. Proceed on foot for some hundred meters along the road towards Castelrotto and then, following the signs for  , you will climb on the left, up to the church (12th century). Once you've reached the fountain in the village centre and after a hairpin bend on the right, go up a stairway located to the left of the street that leads to the entrance of the Villa Orizzonte, the home of Giovanni Rossi to whom the introduction of Merlot in Ticino has been attributed. It was exactly in these vineyards, behind the elegant villa from the 1800s that the Merlot adventure came to life in the canton. Today these same vineyards are kept and farmed by Christian Z\u00fcndel. Continuing along the little street you will arrive at the Vallombrosa Estate. Even here the first vineyards were planted by Giovanni Rossi for his experiments. Today they are managed by the Claudio Tamborini wine cellar that in 2012 was awarded the best wine of Switzerland. Return to the fountain and take the street following the indications for Ronco. In the vicinity of a bridge, turn right while following the   signs. You enter a forest, firstly coming across a small cellar and then an old abandoned dairy. Not far from there you climb up a gravel road to reach an area with a beautiful view and with vast vineyards, owned by Z\u00fcndel and Adriano Kaufmann. Once you reach the intersection, go down towards Ronco to continue the itinerary, whereas to visit the Z\u00fcndel or Kaufmann wine cellars (only upon reservation) you have to go up to the village of Beride. The Z\u00fcndel wine cellar is located behind the church while Kaufmann's is in the opposite direction, about 200-300 meters along the road that leads to Bedigliora. After the detour of the two wine cellars, return to the intersection and, following  , go down towards Ronco. Along the course two other detours are indicated. The first, the so-called  , a glacier, or rather a ditch 4 meters deep, that was filled with pressed snow and used for food preservation. The second, nearby Ronco, leads to the mist net built at the end of the 1700s, used to catch birds in transit. Through the luxuriant chestnut woods you finally return to the departure point. Alternately, the second trails winds through Mendrisiotto, at the extreme south of Ticino. This magnificent region, with its hills, vineyards and old towns reminiscent of Tuscany, is the richest wine-growing area in Ticino. Thanks to its Mediterranean climate and favorable position, its vineyards produce grapes of the highest quality.  The circular trail starts from Seseglio, a small town lying at the foot of the Penz hill. In the Moreggi area, the \u2018sosta dei fungiatt\u2019 (T.N.; meaning \u2018mushroom seekers\u2019 stop\u2019) pays homage to the hill\u2019s abundant mycological treasures, with almost 500 different mushroom species.   While strolling amidst vineyards and woods of broad-leaved trees you will reach the southernmost point of Switzerland, an area known as \"Laghetto\" (T.N.; meaning \u2018small lake\u2019), although it does not actually have a lake. A little further on, you will come to a belvedere offering a panoramic view over the houses and areas below it. The trail is further enhanced by the picturesque village of Pedrinate and the small, historical church of Santo Stefano, which is set apart on a small hillock and not usually open for public viewing.  An anecdote: along the path you will notice a row of birch trees. According to legend, at night, their white trunks served as a guide for smugglers.  Along the path, excursionists will find lots of information panels offering facts about grafts and viticulture, the vegetative cycle of vineyards and disease protection methods.\n                                ",

The flora and fauna of these vast and silent spaces are of great interest. It is still possible to encounter eagles, chamois, roe deer, groundhogs, red frogs and admire the beautiful blossoming of gentians, buttercups, arnica and wild orchids. You can get there with one of Europe's steepest funiculars that leaves from Piotta. Extremely numerous are the signposted trails that cross the region and are of various difficulty and length. We recommend two of them.\n                                 \n                                 The Ritom funicular operates from mid-May to mid-October and allows you to reach an altitude of 1,800 meters without hardship. It starts from Piotta and has a gradient of 87%. Its arrival station is close to the Ritom dam. What opens up to the visitor is the Alpine scenery of the Piora Valley, long approximately 8 km, with vast pastures and pretty lakes. The first suggested path, the trail of the three small lakes, doesn't require getting up at the break of dawn and it starts from the Ritom, the biggest lake. The trail runs along the lake until the detour for lake Tom. An ascent of about 30 minutes leads to the enchanting basin with its small body of water and the pasture's stable. Walking along the Tom's shore you reach the opposite bank and continue along a small ascent towards the ridge. From here you can see the third lake, the Cadagno. After that, go down to the group of houses. Shortly after you reach the Alpe Piora (Piora Pasture) where an excellent and very sought-after cheese is produced. Next to the dairy is the Alpine Biology Center, a university structure housed by a few rustic but well renovated buildings. Continue to the Cadagno cabin. At the dairy you may purchase cheese, butter and ricotta while the mountain cabin is inviting for a break (polenta, cheese, cured meats and cream cakes). Not to miss, the Piora cheese tasting, one of the best in Ticino. To go back to the Ritom dam follow the \"educational trail\" on the opposite bank of the lake, conceived in 2009. A very special excursion in a wonderful region where the mountain and lake landscapes are majestic and where the Alpine flora and fauna always reserve interesting surprises. This is the segment of the crossing that unites the two spectacular regions of Ritom and  , between the Leventina and Blenio Valleys: a course that is mostly leveled, fairly easy and does not require any particular skills. It is however demanding in terms of length as the walk amounts to approximately 5 hours, not including breaks. For this reason it is important to plan the day accordingly, in order to be able to make use of public transportation to and from the departure point. One possibility is to go to Biasca early in the morning with a private mode of transport (or public if you prefer), then go to Faido by train and then by bus to Piotta, where you find the funicular that goes up to the Ritom-Piora highland. At the arrival station (1,793 meters) you should follow the road that leads to Lake Ritom, vast and rich with fish. On the gravel-road you reach then Cadagno and the Alpe Piora, known for its  , one of the most sought-after in Ticino. The landscape is of great environmental importance. In fact, since a couple of years it has become home of the Alpine Biology Center, an academic centre that promotes scientific research in the region. The lake Cadagno is a subject of study of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH) because it presents a rare natural phenomena: its waters are separated in two different overlapping layers that, thanks to the activity of some bacteria, do not mix. Continuing towards the Lucomagno Pass, you will cross the Piora Valley through fields, streams, huts and herds whose cowbells can be heard from a distance. The walk takes place at an altitude of about 2,000 meters. Flowers with striking colors appear here and there, it is not infrequent to spot groundhogs and the sky is mirrored in the small lakes' blue waters. Once you've reached the Alpe Carorescio start the ascent that, without too much effort, will bring you to the Passo del Sole (Sun Pass). Along this segment you can get glimpses of the Campanitt peaks. From the Pass, at an altitude of 2,376 meters, enjoy the spectacular view over the entire Lucomagno area.

        "description": "\n                                The Alpine landscape of the Piora Valley, rich in green pastures in bloom with scattered little lakes, is one of the most idyllic in Ticino. The flora and fauna of these vast and silent spaces are of great interest. It is still possible to encounter eagles, chamois, roe deer, groundhogs, red frogs and admire the beautiful blossoming of gentians, buttercups, arnica and wild orchids. You can get there with one of Europe's steepest funiculars that leaves from Piotta. Extremely numerous are the signposted trails that cross the region and are of various difficulty and length. We recommend two of them.\n                                 \n                                 The Ritom funicular operates from mid-May to mid-October and allows you to reach an altitude of 1,800 meters without hardship. It starts from Piotta and has a gradient of 87%. Its arrival station is close to the Ritom dam. What opens up to the visitor is the Alpine scenery of the Piora Valley, long approximately 8 km, with vast pastures and pretty lakes. The first suggested path, the trail of the three small lakes, doesn't require getting up at the break of dawn and it starts from the Ritom, the biggest lake. The trail runs along the lake until the detour for lake Tom. An ascent of about 30 minutes leads to the enchanting basin with its small body of water and the pasture's stable. Walking along the Tom's shore you reach the opposite bank and continue along a small ascent towards the ridge. From here you can see the third lake, the Cadagno. After that, go down to the group of houses. Shortly after you reach the Alpe Piora (Piora Pasture) where an excellent and very sought-after cheese is produced. Next to the dairy is the Alpine Biology Center, a university structure housed by a few rustic but well renovated buildings. Continue to the Cadagno cabin. At the dairy you may purchase cheese, butter and ricotta while the mountain cabin is inviting for a break (polenta, cheese, cured meats and cream cakes). Not to miss, the Piora cheese tasting, one of the best in Ticino. To go back to the Ritom dam follow the \"educational trail\" on the opposite bank of the lake, conceived in 2009. A very special excursion in a wonderful region where the mountain and lake landscapes are majestic and where the Alpine flora and fauna always reserve interesting surprises. This is the segment of the crossing that unites the two spectacular regions of Ritom and  , between the Leventina and Blenio Valleys: a course that is mostly leveled, fairly easy and does not require any particular skills. It is however demanding in terms of length as the walk amounts to approximately 5 hours, not including breaks. For this reason it is important to plan the day accordingly, in order to be able to make use of public transportation to and from the departure point. One possibility is to go to Biasca early in the morning with a private mode of transport (or public if you prefer), then go to Faido by train and then by bus to Piotta, where you find the funicular that goes up to the Ritom-Piora highland. At the arrival station (1,793 meters) you should follow the road that leads to Lake Ritom, vast and rich with fish. On the gravel-road you reach then Cadagno and the Alpe Piora, known for its  , one of the most sought-after in Ticino. The landscape is of great environmental importance.

In just a few minutes, the cable car (operating from June to October) takes you from the village of Rodi-Fiesso right up to the Tremorgio hut (1850 meters): a 900 metre ascent which allows you to save a lot of energy. On reaching the top, you will be offered a fabulous view of the lake whose waters have been used for nearly a century to produce electricity. In autumn 2012, the Carlo Danzi Foundation promoted and funded the construction of a trail that allows you to walk around the lake: an easy, 3-km hike along flat ground, which takes about 40 minutes. Local products and hot meals can be enjoyed at the hut during the summer. On the other hand the vast plain of Alpe Campolungo (2100 metres), crossed by a crystal-clear stream, can be reached in less than an hour\u2019s walk from the cable car arrival station. An idyllic place, rich in minerals, studied by many researchers. During summer, the meadows abound in lush vegetation, and flowering shrubs add a touch of colour to the landscape. Here you can admire gentians, anemones, rhododendrons, buttercups, columbines as well as many other flowering species. While climbing up to Lake Le\u00ect (\u201cLe\u00ect\u201d meaning \"small lakes\" in Leventina dialect), which can be reached in about 45 minutes, the pasture gives way to rock. The landscape changes appearance and is dominated by the magnificent Pizzo Prevat silhouetted against the sky. It is a much-loved summit often tackled by mountain climbers who test their skills on this demanding ascent. The Leit Hut is the perfect place to take a pit stop, enjoying simple dishes including polenta served with regional alpine cheeses. Hikers will have to walk for another 45 minutes along a fairly steep, rather challenging path, before coming upon another hidden treasure, namely Lake Varozzeira (2400 metres), boasting a beautiful, almost purple colour.  Overall, allow about two hours to get to Lake Le\u00ect from Tremorgio (just under three hours to Lake Varozzeira). Anyone wishing to try their hand at a more challenging hike, or stay in the area overnight, can take the three-and-a-half hour climb up to the Campo Tencia Hut (the first hut built in the Ticino Alps, it was opened in 1912) and the eponymous Pizzo Campo Tencia, which, standing at a height of 3701 metres, is the highest peak in the Ticino area (calculate around 3 hours from the hut) Inaugurated in the summer of 2016, the geo-tourism trail of Campolungo comprises two routes, a flatter one skirting Lake Tremorgio, and a more challenging one that leads to the Leit Hut.

Ticino is thus one of the most popular places for free climbing in the entire Alpine range: from Vallemaggia to  \n                                Free climbing enthusiasts will most definitely have a chance to match their strengths on Ticino\u2019s granite and gneiss rock faces: there are, in fact, some 70 areas scattered throughout the area, where this sport can be practiced. There are loads of diverse and well-equipped rock walls, many of which have cracks serving as an aid to climbing.  The most famous places to practice free climbing in the neighborhood of Locarno are definitely Arcegno and Balladrum (on   in  ).  Just outside the residential area of Arcegno, amidst chestnut woods and small ponds of naturalistic interest, you will find countless well-equipped routes of different grades to suit all tastes: more than 100 single-pitch routes on very rough rock. From the summit of the walls, the view extends over lush natural surroundings, Locarno and the delta of River Maggia. Please note: in this area, natural environments and biotopes are protected! Climbing is permitted from spring to late autumn. Along the forest road leading from Monte Verit\u00e0 to   you will find the two climbing areas of Balladrum. The lower part includes about ten technical routes of moderate difficulty, the upper part boasts the same number of routes which are, however, easy and ideal for beginners. The view over   is absolutely breathtaking, to say the least. The place is very warm and sunny, meaning that clear winter days are most likely to be your best climbing option.   Vallemaggia, with its vast mountainous territory, offers beautiful and diverse natural rock faces for free climbing: at the entrance to the valley in Ponte Brolla, at Avegno, Cevio, Someo, Brontallo and Mognola (Lavizzara Valley), Bosco Gurin or Naret, you have the opportunity to test your skills on cliff faces or particularly long trails.  Ponte Brolla is a classic destination for aficionados of \u2018plaisir\u2019 climbing. An area set within wild natural surroundings highlighted by the scenic gorges of River Maggia, further enhanced by a magnificent view over the region. In the area you can find hundreds of well-equipped routes for climbers of all levels, many of which are also ideal for beginners. Avegno in the Torbeccio area offers a number of easy and difficult routes, while the rock walls behind the grottos are distinguished by the length of the trails.  Someo and Cevio boast free climbing cliff faces for high grade enthusiasts while the wild Val Calnegia ( ) offers longer, more difficult routes for those who prefer friction climbing. Upstream of  , the highest village in Ticino, in a magnificent Alpine basin standing at an altitude of 2,300 meters you will find a wide choice of breathtaking, well-equipped routes.They stretch over solid, rough gneiss having a granite-like appearance, distinguished by plates, crevices and vertical walls with notches for climbers of all levels and all styles. The ideal period for climbing the area above Bosco Gurin is from spring to late autumn. Owing to the fact that it is situated near to the alpine crest, the area is strongly influenced by northerly winds meaning that climbers should watch out for sudden changes in the weather.   Immediately above the town of Brontallo (Lavizzara Valley), the magnificent, sunny rock face of \u201cEl Cat\u201d offers various athletic, technical and resistance climbing options on well-worn, solid gneiss, along some twenty well-equipped routes.  On account of being exposed to the south, southwest, this rock face is suitable for winter, spring and autumnal climbs. During the winter season it is kissed by the sun from 10am to 3pm. Conversely, during warmer months, climbing is not recommended.   In the same valley, an imposing, steep, white-striated wall, furrowed with crevices and overhangs characterizes the cliff above the village of Prato Sornico. A tough, thrilling climbing-area that tends to be overcast in the morning and sunny in the afternoon and features more than 50 single-pitch routes of moderate to high difficulty. In the impressive alpine landscape around Lake Mognola (above Fusio), some 90 routes have been carved on crags of outstanding rock. Overhangs, vertical walls and technical slab offer fun for climbers of all levels. The exposure of some sectors allows climbing even during hot summer days. The sectors are scattered along the path that leads from Lake Mognola to the ancient aqueduct carved into the rock Also the region of Naret boasts a number of different, well-equipped routes, which are, however, all of Alpine nature. Just above the village of Russo you will find the eponymous cliff: a scenic, peaceful, sunny area, even during short winter days. On this rock face there are around 40 pitches and the climb features several vertical, challenging gaping crevices.  The plates of Paleria, in Berzona, offer various climbing routes featuring several friction-style pitches. The lower part is suitable for beginners while the upper part is recommended for more expert climbers. In addition to a beautiful   with crystal-clear waters, Verzasca Valley offers a number of magnificent free climbing areas. On the imposing, vertical, south-facing rock wall of Eus, boasting more than 300 meters of truly outstanding, varied rock, you will find several high-level routes, among the most beautiful in Ticino. An ideal spot for mid-season and, in the absence of snow, even winter climbing.  The southern rock face of Poncione d\u2019Alnasca, both isolated and exposed, is probably the most beautiful in the whole of Ticino. On this grandiose pyramid standing at an altitude of 500 meters, you will find a number of different routes. However, this type of rock is only suitable for truly expert climbers. Pizzo Pr\u00e9vat, Cristallina,  Pass, Piansecco, Ch\u00fcebodenhorn, Poncione di Ruino and Passo di Mani\u00f2: these are just some of the breathtaking climbing routes in the region lying behind St. Gotthard. In Bedretto Valley, on Poncione di Ruino and Poncione di Cassina Baggio you can find a number of varied and interesting alpine trails. Its relatively high altitude, its favorable position and the variety of itineraries available mean that climbers can tackle these rock faces during all seasons (even in winter, by following the approach on skis, climbers can embark on a number of pleasant ascents).   There are also some interesting cliffs in the vicinity of the Piansecco Hut. Finally, at Passo di Mani\u00f2, there are more than 30 well-equipped, single-pitch routes of moderate to high difficulty on rock that is generally excellent. Another mountain which is well known to climbers is Pizzo Pr\u00e9vat in Leventina Valley: an elegant, slender rocky tower that rises above the meadows of Alpe Campolungo, renowned for its graceful, harmonious shape. Its rock faces boast a number of beautiful alpine trails.  Alpe Campolungo is easily accessible via the cableway that ascends from Rodi-Fiesso as far as Lake  , from where you continue by foot. \t This imposing rock face acts as a challenge to countless climbers. More than 650 artificial handholds have been installed on the concave wall of the dam for 165m of sheer verticality, where those climbing it have to reach five pitches and where, in succession, each length of rope is more demanding than the previous one. A unique rock face of stunning scenic beauty! To climb the dam you need to ask for the access keys, available at the restaurant lying adjacent to dam.   Situated in the mountains acting as a backdrop to the gulf of Lugano, the \"Denti della Vecchia\" represent one of Ticino\u2019s most historic climbing areas. Generations of climbers have explored the walls, cliffs and precipices of these small, evocative \u2018Ticino Dolomites\u2019. The \"Denti della Vecchia\" offer climbing enthusiasts more than 120 routes of different grades. The view from its summits are breathtaking and embrace the entire area of Lugano, stretching towards the peaks of Vallemaggia, Verzasca Valley and further on, the Valais Alps.   The main starting point to climb the \"Denti della Vecchia\" is the Pairolo Hut, which also boasts a rock face for climbing on its outer wall. All the necessary gear is available on site.

Plenty of places for refreshment and playgrounds en route. At ten kilometres, the second stage of the Swiss Path is the longest, but as it follows the shore of the lake, it is also the easiest. On the section between Isleten and Fl\u00fcelen, the lakeside path is fully accessible, making it possible for wheelchair users to enjoy the cultural trail. The stage begins in Bauen, where the gables of its traditional central Swiss farmhouses face towards the lake.  Lush gardens are home to palm trees, fig trees and other exotic plants. Narrow alleyways, terracing walls and small squares emphasise the Mediterranean panache, thanks to its lakeside location and frequent Foehn winds. Another special feature is that the village is vehicle-free and can only be reached via water by public transport. Following the lake shore, you leave Bauen in a southerly direction. The hillside is overgrown with dense forest and becomes so steep that the trail continues through the mountain. You will find yourself in cool rock galleries with stunning views of Lake Uri. Part of the route on long wooden footbridges along the shore also runs parallel with the road. Due to the danger of falling rocks, the final 400 metres of the path had to be closed and the hiking route was moved to the road tunnel. The lake calls to you in Isleten. This is located on the flat delta of the Isentalerbach stream and has attractive bathing sites. Isleten is also popular with surfers because of the favourable wind conditions. The Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, produced explosives here from 1873. These were mainly used in the construction of the Gotthard railway tunnel. You now continue on a superb gravel path along the shore in the direction of Fl\u00fcelen. A number of benches and fire pits invite you to linger. On the shore, the water of the lake sloshes relentlessly against dark boulders. Another highlight awaits you behind the lake resort in the municipality of Seedorf. In the Reuss Delta nature protection area, fens, reed meadows, islands, shallow water areas, watercourses and ditches offer valuable refuge for rare plants and more than 200 species of birds, insects, mussels and fish. However, bathers are catered for here too. You can lay out your beach towel on the three Lorelei islands, which were created using material excavated from the Gotthard Base Tunnel. After around two kilometres, the trail takes you right through the middle of the natural paradise. It is also worth going up the wooden lookout tower made of willow. You have a superb panoramic view of the lake, the mountains and the Reuss estuary from this architectural masterpiece by the Grisons architect Gion Caminada. From here it is just a stone\u2019s throw to Fl\u00fcelen, the destination for this stage. Rudenz Castle with its castle park that is open to the public, invites you to make a detour here. You can admire a mountain crystal exhibition in the former church, which now has a variety of uses.",

This approximately 4-hour, leisurely panoramic hike to the Bellwald mountain lakes is also fun for children. Time and again there are opportunities for water games. The area above Bellwald is vast, and the tour can therefore be shortened or extended as desired. You start at the top station of the Furggulti chairlift. Before you reach the Wirbulsee lake, you will come to a turn-off in the direction of the Mittelsee lake. If you want, you can shorten the hike here. That would be a pity, of course. If you are lucky, you will meet some cuddly black-nosed sheep typical in Valais, grazing leisurely on the meadows along the slightly ascending path. It takes only a few minutes to the Lengsee. The path is relatively even, and in no time you arrive at the turnoff towards the Honeggerhorn. This is the highest point of the tour. A detour down to the Brusee is worthwhile: above the ridge, a magnificent view opens up in the direction of Obergoms. Afterwards, the rest of the tour is entirely downhill.

The hike through the spectacular alpine landscapes shaped by glaciers promises beautiful views of the dam with its lake, the wild Moiry valley at the end of the Val d'Anniviers, and the glittering Moiry glacier. This panoramic hike takes you around the turquoise-blue Moiry reservoir. If you\u2019re interested, you can learn more about electricity production on a guided tour inside the dam before or after the hike. A fascinating detail: thanks to a network of tunnels, the lake collects water not only from the Moiry valley, but also from neighbouring valleys. On the way down into the Rhone valley, you pass three hydroelectric power plants. The energy produced covers the electricity needs of more than 120,000 Swiss households. Start and finish of the circular hiking tour is the dam. From here, the steeply winding trail zigzags up the eastern slope above the lake to around 2,370 metres, after which the trail branches off to the south. First uphill, then alternatingly up and down, you reach the end of the lake and cross the alpine pastures of \"F\u00eata d'Ao\u00fbt de Ch\u00e2teaupr\u00e9\", before the trail descends steeply to the glacial waters of the Ch\u00e2teaupr\u00e9 lake. Here, the mountain stream Gougra is also crossed, which feeds the reservoir with the glacial water of the Moiry glacier. It is located about five kilometres south of the lake below the Pointe de Mourti. After crossing the river, the trail climbs again over the glacial moraine to just under 2,500 metres. Now you continue across the flank on the other side of the valley. Along the way, the small lakes \"Lac de la Bayenna\" and \"Lac du Louch\u00e9\" invite you to take a break before the final descent. Of course, the break can also wait until you get to the restaurant back at the dam, where a terrace with a lake view awaits.

First uphill, then alternatingly up and down, you reach the end of the lake and cross the alpine pastures of \"F\u00eata d'Ao\u00fbt de Ch\u00e2teaupr\u00e9\", before the trail descends steeply to the glacial waters of the Ch\u00e2teaupr\u00e9 lake. Here, the mountain stream Gougra is also crossed, which feeds the reservoir with the glacial water of the Moiry glacier. It is located about five kilometres south of the lake below the Pointe de Mourti. After crossing the river, the trail climbs again over the glacial moraine to just under 2,500 metres. Now you continue across the flank on the other side of the valley. Along the way, the small lakes \"Lac de la Bayenna\" and \"Lac du Louch\u00e9\" invite you to take a break before the final descent. Of course, the break can also wait until you get to the restaurant back at the dam, where a terrace with a lake view awaits. Climbing fans won\u2019t miss out either and can enjoy the via ferrata to the left of the dam."

We have chosen two routes that are accessible to bikers at all levels and also offer bike-hire-options. The first trail winds along a track devoted entirely to cycling; it is suitable for families and connects  \n                                Mountain bike enthusiasts are offered a wide variety of trails around the cities, in che valleys and in the Ticino mountains, clearly marked on the TicinoTurismo website. Aficionados of more extreme downhill experiences will find a variety of options at the Airolo Bike Park (Leventina valley) and at the Bike Park Nara (Blenio Valley). There are also numerous marked trails for breathtaking descents from the peaks, with the possibility of ascending by public transport: on Monte Generoso in the Mendrisiotto region; on Monte Lema and on Monte Tamaro in the Lugano region; at Cardada-Cimetta in the Locarno region, just to name a few. In this section, we have chosen two excursions that are suitable for riders of all levels. This first, family-friendly excursion leaves from the town of Ascona and ends in Bellinzona, the capital of Ticino and a UNESCO World Heritage site, renowned for its castles. Bicycles can be hired from the railway stations of Locarno and Bellinzona.  The trail starts on the lakefront promenade of  . After riding along the shores of Lake Maggiore and passing a   course, you will reach  , from where the route continues along the banks of the Maggia River. After passing the  and riding along the cycling path on the shores of the lake you will reach Tenero. After passing the national Sports Centre, you will enter the Magadino Plain. Just a little further on, between the mouths of the Ticino and   rivers, you will come across the \u2018 \u2019, recognized throughout Switzerland as an area of significant naturalistic importance. By following the marked cycling routes and riding in the direction of Bellinzona along peaceful country roads and through breathtaking areas of wetland you will cross the Magadino Plain known as the orchard of the Canton. Winding through meadows, cultivated fields and vineyards, the trail is dotted with a number of small farms (agritourisms) where bikers can stop and sample or purchase typical, locally grown products. On reaching Bellinzona, the capital of Ticino, make sure to visit its charming historic center where a lively   is held on Saturdays. Other must-see attractions include its three  .  A comfortable all downhill   from Airolo (1160 m) to Biasca (301 m) along a 40 km course. You can rent the bikes in Airolo and return them in Biasca following the beautiful itinerary that unwinds on the floor of the valley, partially on secondary roads, along the  . Along the way you will go through places of interest such as the Dazio Grande at the opening of the striking Gole del Piottino (Piottino Gorge), the village of Giornico with the splendid Romanesque church of San Nicola and the outstanding churches of SS. Pietro e Paolo (Saints Peter and Paul) and of Santa Petronilla in Biasca. From Airolo, go down the Cantonal road towards Quinto/Piotta. Just outside the village of Rodi-Fiesso you will run into the Dazio Grande (old custom check point) where travelers in the past were required to stop and pay a toll for merchandise and people, with the option of also having a rest and a refreshment. In fact, a little further travelers were faced with a serious obstacle: the narrow gorge that the River Ticino dug in the Monte Piottino rock. From the Dazio Grande you can also have an interesting and easy walk that is well signposted and approximately 1.5 hours long. Along the way, ruins of the Dazio Vecchio, an old customs house erected at the beginning of the 1300s by the Milanese, are visible. Proceed through the woods following the signpost Ponte di Mezzo. Immediately after the bridge, a gangway gives access to the gorge and the \"Uri road\" (old road named after the neighboring canton), a 1500s masterpiece, chiseled from live rock. From there, you will return to the starting point. From the Dazio Grande you can also access the Piottino Gorge by avoiding the abovementioned circular itinerary. Simply walk down the Cantonal road and take the trail that leads to the old mule track and to the gorge. Continue the bike itinerary to reach the village of Faido and then take the peaceful little road towards Nivo where you can admire the nice electric power plant built by Milanese architect Giovanni Greppi according to the Lombard industrial style of the early 1900s. The descent continues down the zigzagging of the Biaschina, true crossroad of the North-South communication route: the A2 freeway with its impressive viaduct inaugurated in 1983, the railway line from 1882 and finally the winding Cantonal road. Above this bottleneck you can observe the trains from the Gottardo line entering and exiting the coiling tunnels designed to overcome the almost 200 meters of gradient. Continue to   where you can visit the modern Ethnographic Museum of the Leventina Valley and the church of San Nicola considered one of the greatest expressions of Romanesque architecture in Ticino. Built in the 12th century with a plain and rigorous style, it sticks out of the vineyards with its stone presence: sturdy, simple and noble. Remarkable are the portal and the Southern facade with the little sculptures, the main facade, the crypt with the mysterious capitals, the apse frescoes and the baptismal font at the entrance. At the end of the bike ride, you will arrive in Biasca, a town that was remarkably important in the past and which still preserves some significant historic monuments. Behind the 16th century Casa Cavalier Pellanda, today a cultural centre and home to the tourist office, stands a parish church dedicated to San Carlo and built in the latter part of the 1800s. From here, take the stairway to the beautiful 12th century Romanesque church of SS. Pietro e Paolo. Precious frescoes are inside (12th-17th centuries). On the right, a trail running along the old cemetery connects to the Via Crucis blessed in 1779. Shaded by chestnut trees, a succession of 14 chapels expose mosaics of contemporary artists. In about twenty minutes on foot you will reach the stone bridge on the Froda stream, the beautiful waterfall and the Santa Petronilla Oratory, rich in frescoes of an unknown author from 1638-1651.\n                                ",

        "description": "\n                                Ticino offers biking enthusiasts endless possibilities: from simpler cycling trails to mountain paths that are suitable for mountain biking, to more extreme downhill trails. We have chosen two routes that are accessible to bikers at all levels and also offer bike-hire-options. The first trail winds along a track devoted entirely to cycling; it is suitable for families and connects  \n                                Mountain bike enthusiasts are offered a wide variety of trails around the cities, in che valleys and in the Ticino mountains, clearly marked on the TicinoTurismo website. Aficionados of more extreme downhill experiences will find a variety of options at the Airolo Bike Park (Leventina valley) and at the Bike Park Nara (Blenio Valley). There are also numerous marked trails for breathtaking descents from the peaks, with the possibility of ascending by public transport: on Monte Generoso in the Mendrisiotto region; on Monte Lema and on Monte Tamaro in the Lugano region; at Cardada-Cimetta in the Locarno region, just to name a few. In this section, we have chosen two excursions that are suitable for riders of all levels. This first, family-friendly excursion leaves from the town of Ascona and ends in Bellinzona, the capital of Ticino and a UNESCO World Heritage site, renowned for its castles. Bicycles can be hired from the railway stations of Locarno and Bellinzona.  The trail starts on the lakefront promenade of  . After riding along the shores of Lake Maggiore and passing a   course, you will reach  , from where the route continues along the banks of the Maggia River. After passing the  and riding along the cycling path on the shores of the lake you will reach Tenero. After passing the national Sports Centre, you will enter the Magadino Plain. Just a little further on, between the mouths of the Ticino and   rivers, you will come across the \u2018 \u2019, recognized throughout Switzerland as an area of significant naturalistic importance. By following the marked cycling routes and riding in the direction of Bellinzona along peaceful country roads and through breathtaking areas of wetland you will cross the Magadino Plain known as the orchard of the Canton. Winding through meadows, cultivated fields and vineyards, the trail is dotted with a number of small farms (agritourisms) where bikers can stop and sample or purchase typical, locally grown products. On reaching Bellinzona, the capital of Ticino, make sure to visit its charming historic center where a lively   is held on Saturdays. Other must-see attractions include its three  .  A comfortable all downhill   from Airolo (1160 m) to Biasca (301 m) along a 40 km course. You can rent the bikes in Airolo and return them in Biasca following the beautiful itinerary that unwinds on the floor of the valley, partially on secondary roads, along the  . Along the way you will go through places of interest such as the Dazio Grande at the opening of the striking Gole del Piottino (Piottino Gorge), the village of Giornico with the splendid Romanesque church of San Nicola and the outstanding churches of SS. Pietro e Paolo (Saints Peter and Paul) and of Santa Petronilla in Biasca. From Airolo, go down the Cantonal road towards Quinto/Piotta. Just outside the village of Rodi-Fiesso you will run into the Dazio Grande (old custom check point) where travelers in the past were required to stop and pay a toll for merchandise and people, with the option of also having a rest and a refreshment. In fact, a little further travelers were faced with a serious obstacle: the narrow gorge that the River Ticino dug in the Monte Piottino rock. From the Dazio Grande you can also have an interesting and easy walk that is well signposted and approximately 1.5 hours long. Along the way, ruins of the Dazio Vecchio, an old customs house erected at the beginning of the 1300s by the Milanese, are visible. Proceed through the woods following the signpost Ponte di Mezzo. Immediately after the bridge, a gangway gives access to the gorge and the \"Uri road\" (old road named after the neighboring canton), a 1500s masterpiece, chiseled from live rock. From there, you will return to the starting point. From the Dazio Grande you can also access the Piottino Gorge by avoiding the abovementioned circular itinerary. Simply walk down the Cantonal road and take the trail that leads to the old mule track and to the gorge. Continue the bike itinerary to reach the village of Faido and then take the peaceful little road towards Nivo where you can admire the nice electric power plant built by Milanese architect Giovanni Greppi according to the Lombard industrial style of the early 1900s. The descent continues down the zigzagging of the Biaschina, true crossroad of the North-South communication route: the A2 freeway with its impressive viaduct inaugurated in 1983, the railway line from 1882 and finally the winding Cantonal road. Above this bottleneck you can observe the trains from the Gottardo line entering and exiting the coiling tunnels designed to overcome the almost 200 meters of gradient. Continue to   where you can visit the modern Ethnographic Museum of the Leventina Valley and the church of San Nicola considered one of the greatest expressions of Romanesque architecture in Ticino. Built in the 12th century with a plain and rigorous style, it sticks out of the vineyards with its stone presence: sturdy, simple and noble. Remarkable are the portal and the Southern facade with the little sculptures, the main facade, the crypt with the mysterious capitals, the apse frescoes and the baptismal font at the entrance. At the end of the bike ride, you will arrive in Biasca, a town that was remarkably important in the past and which still preserves some significant historic monuments. Behind the 16th century Casa Cavalier Pellanda, today a cultural centre and home to the tourist office, stands a parish church dedicated to San Carlo and built in the latter part of the 1800s. From here, take the stairway to the beautiful 12th century Romanesque church of SS. Pietro e Paolo. Precious frescoes are inside (12th-17th centuries). On the right, a trail running along the old cemetery connects to the Via Crucis blessed in 1779. Shaded by chestnut trees, a succession of 14 chapels expose mosaics of contemporary artists. In about twenty minutes on foot you will reach the stone bridge on the Froda stream, the beautiful waterfall and the Santa Petronilla Oratory, rich in frescoes of an unknown author from 1638-1651.\n                                "

Following the trail (identified with white/red markings) indicating Orsino-Realp, you head towards the Lucendro Dam.

Standing at an altitude of 2286 metres its banks are part gravel and part grass, while its waters are of such a deep blue color that they almost seem to be an open eye looking upwards towards the sky. Just a little further you will see a farmhouse.  As you climb upwards you can continue to admire this beautiful small lake while other two are already getting closer: those of the Orsirora. The first is of a deep green color, while the second is blue. Who knows if their name is in some way associated with the past presence of bears in the region? On the way, you will also encounter other two small lakes called Valletta (2468 and 2432 m) and, further on, several more, boasting iridescent blue or emerald waters, that are bizarrely shaped, and which also reflect the sky and the mountains. Set amidst moss and rocks, these sparkling pools of water, stirred by light breezes that ripple their surface, will most definitely enchant visitors. They are all beautiful, whether you decide to stop and admire them from their banks, immersed in silence, or whether you decide to view them from above.  Along the route you will be surrounded by Alpine flora and fauna and who knows, you might even happen to chance upon a few timid marmots. The trail takes around 5 hours without stops.

A large number of enthusiasts from all over the world set out to participate in this breathtaking adventure, reserved however, solely to those boasting the necessary skills and experience.\n                                "

The Bretaye railway station (at 1,800 metres above sea level) can be reached by a narrow-gauge railway from Villars. The backdrop at the start of your hike: Mont Blanc, Dents du Midi and the entire Vaud Alps. The circular route around the Chaux Ronde, a 2,000-metre-high ridge, begins on the south-facing plateau. Just below the Roc \u00e0 l\u2019Ours rock formation, the trail leads to the picturesque alpine hamlet of Ensex.

After the alpine meadows, you arrive at the Col de la Croix (1,778 metres) mountain pass, connecting Villars and Les Diablerets. A particular highlight awaits you here: the pointed gypsum pyramids. Water and wind have eroded these sedimentary geological structures over the years and shaped them into magnificent rock formations. Their karst morphology bears witness to a unique geological history. Surrounded by pristine nature, the route continues to Col d'Encr\u00e8ne and then down to the Perche alpine meadows.  Cows, marmots, and chamois will be your companions on the way to Lake Chavonnes. Continue along the mountain lake, which lies nestled between rock cliffs and unspoilt forests. Legend has it that the lake holds a hidden treasure guarded by the monster of Lake Chavonnes. The white diamonds on the lake's bottom can still be seen twinkling in the moon- or sunlight.

After a steep climb, the romantic high-level trail towards Seelisberg. Far below, the shimmering turquoise lake. The first human traces in the area around Stans date back to the 2nd century BC. In 1713, a fire destroyed two thirds of the village. Stans owes its stately baroque houses, the Winkelried fountain and the town hall to the drastic building regulations that were subsequently passed.

The village was built on an alluvial plain between the Buochserhorn and the imposing panoramic B\u00fcrgenstock in the middle part of lake Lucerne.  After a good half hour along the lakeshore and another through residential neighbourhoods, you reach Beckenried. The holiday resort is located at the foot of the Klewenalp, the popular hiking region can be reached by cable car. After another thirty minutes, the Trans Swiss Trail separates from the Via Jacobi. While the latter climbs up to Emmetten and circles the pre-alpine mountain terrace, the Trans Swiss Trail continues to follow lake Lucerne to Risleten. Now you require more stamina: past the waterfall, the trail climbs a steep 200 metres to Haselholzboden.  The Via Jacobi rejoins the route at Haselholzboden.

The ascent from Sisikon is rough but rewarded by panoramic views. An aqua park beckons in Morschach. Fl\u00fcelen is located on the shore of Lake Uri under the steep forested hillside of the Eggberge. The former church is now used in a variety of ways and houses a rock crystal exhibition. Rudenz Castle, with its castle park that is open to the public, also invites you to linger. In the south of Fl\u00fcelen lies the natural paradise of the Reuss Delta, which is alluring with its flat moors, reed meadows and bathing islands. Between the train station and the landing stage, where steamboats dock regularly, is the start of the hike along the shore of the lake in a northerly direction. The cantons gifted the Swiss Path to the population of Switzerland in 1991. The cantons of Schaffhausen, the two Appenzells and St. Gallen were allowed to design this section of the trail in the order in which they joined the Swiss Confederation. A wooden bench shaped like a deck chair invites you to relax. Screeching seagulls, honking ships and the warm Foehn wind ensure a holiday mood. The train sounds remind you of the presence of the important north-south axis from Zurich to Milan, which runs parallel to long stretches of the route. On the lake promenade, you can walk comfortably along the hillside between the tracks and water. A narrow wooden footbridge goes underneath the Sulzegg viaduct. You are fast approaching the spectacular section on the rock faces of the Axenflue. The path was built into and through the rock and it provides a vertical view downwards from the old Axenstrasse onto the rock face to the azure blue Lake Uri and the surrounding mountains. The narrow paths are well maintained, and incorporate disused railway sleepers that serve as steps. Huge rock arches and pillars support the mountain under which the hikers pass, and they give you an idea of the effort involved in building the old Axenstrasse. Before this was opened in 1865, the important north-south traffic between Brunnen and Fl\u00fcelen had to be loaded onto ships. Now comes the descent back to the lake shore. Eighty steps above the Tell\u2019s Chapel, the Swiss chocolate industry has created the largest glockenspiel in Switzerland. During the day, one of around twenty melodies is played for the first few minutes of every hour. Further down on the lake shore, Wilhelm Tell is said to have escaped by jumping out of the bailiff Gessler's boat to the Tellsplatte to save himself. Four frescoes in the chapel depict the R\u00fctli oath, the shooting of the apple, Tell\u2019s leap and Gessler\u2019s death in the Hohle Gasse. A stunning trail follows the shore past the Tellsplatte. Beneath gnarled pine trees and past steep cliffs, you pass by several attractive places rest. Sometimes the trail is right next to the water, with small waves engulfing the large boulders beneath them. You reach Sisikon via winding steps and with a wonderful view of the surrounding mountains. The valley station of the Tw\u00e4rr\u00fcti-Buggialp cable car is above Sisikon. It offers a panoramic journey with a view over Lake Lucerne to the Rigi and the Pilatus.",

Further down on the lake shore, Wilhelm Tell is said to have escaped by jumping out of the bailiff Gessler's boat to the Tellsplatte to save himself. Four frescoes in the chapel depict the R\u00fctli oath, the shooting of the apple, Tell\u2019s leap and Gessler\u2019s death in the Hohle Gasse. A stunning trail follows the shore past the Tellsplatte. Beneath gnarled pine trees and past steep cliffs, you pass by several attractive places rest. Sometimes the trail is right next to the water, with small waves engulfing the large boulders beneath them. You reach Sisikon via winding steps and with a wonderful view of the surrounding mountains. The valley station of the Tw\u00e4rr\u00fcti-Buggialp cable car is above Sisikon. It offers a panoramic journey with a view over Lake Lucerne to the Rigi and the Pilatus."

It is a hike characterised by pastures, high-plateaus and lakes The Val da Camp is reached either on foot or with the small postbus from Sfaz\u00f9. Cars are not allowed here, so a reservation is recommended if you want to save yourself the walk up to the Alp da Camp. The postbus snakes its way up on a gravel road through the idyllic nature reserve and past the settlements of Buril, Salva, Mottacalva and Lungacqua. The backdrop on arrival: lush green meadows, alpine flowers and a magnificent mountain world. Shortly after the start, the paths fork to the lakes of Lagh da Saoseo and Lagh da Val Viola. The hiking tour can be done in both directions. It winds its way between pine and larch forests and open alpine meadows to the two lakes which have a landslide area in between. The better-known lake is the Lagh da Saoseo. It makes you think of an optical illusion: deep blue and intensely luminous, it is considered to be one of the most beautiful mountain lakes in Switzerland. With its wild shore full of stones and tree trunks, it is popular with landscape photographers. How did it get its incredible colour? Legend has it that a rock spirit is reflected in the water. The princess had to find him, because only then would she be allowed to marry the prince. Her patience paid off: when the spirit showed itself, she threw a few blue flowers into the water. As a result, the lake took on their colour - and has retained it to this day.  Rather dark violet in colour, as its name suggests, the Lagh da Val Viola nestles in the gentle hollow at the foot of the Scima da Saoseo. It has the shape of an eye and is surrounded by larches and pines. From the lake, you have a clear view of the Val Mera opposite. Please note: the Val da Camp and especially the area around the Lagh da Saoseo are heavily frequented in summer. If possible, it is better not to plan this hike on a weekend during the high season.",

The Matterhorn is reflected in three of the mountain lakes and the view of the towering peaks is awe-inspiring. The trail connects the Stellisee, Grindjisee, Gr\u00fcnsee, Moosjisee and Leisee lakes. The Sunnegga funicular takes just 4 minutes to get from Zermatt to the Sunnegga station at 2,288 m, followed by a 6-seater gondola ride to Blauherd. The trail down to Stellisee, the first of the five lakes, is mostly flat. With the two boulders in the middle and the clear reflection of the Matterhorn it is a popular place to take pictures. The Fluhalp mountain restaurant is close by. The 5-Lakes Trail now continues gently downhill to Grindjisee, a highlight especially for botany buffs. The small lake offers a surprisingly rich moorland flora and rare flowers. The path then crosses over to the other side of the valley to Gr\u00fcnsee and leads through a former glacial area. With some luck, there will be some of the typical black-nosed sheep of the Valais around. Benches with a view of the Matterhorn are a temptation to linger and the views from the \u201cZe Seewjinu\u201d mountain lodge ranging from Matterhorn to Weisshorn are unparalleled. Next up is Moosjisee, a classic reservoir fed by glaciers and the reason why its colour is milky-white. The water is used to generate power and make man-made snow. The hiking trail then continues in the direction of the hamlet of Findeln, the dining hotspot of the Zermatt mountains, before the ascent to Leisee, the last of the lakes. Those who prefer to skip it can walk down to Zermatt in about 40 minutes. The Leisee is fun mostly for the kids who love to splash around in it. The Sunnegga station is just a short stroll from here, but there is always the Leisee-Shuttle to ride up to the station.",

This food finds its roots at the times of the Romans and the Greeks. In Ticino the sweet corn   propagated relatively slowly starting from the 1800s. Many amusing legends are told about corn, called   in the Ticino dialect. One in particular attributes its distribution to San Carlo Borromeo. Moved by the suffering of the Ticino population during a famine, he is said having transformed a poisonous cereal into an edible plant. Although some luxury restaurants re-elaborated the recipe with elegant interpretations,   remains a rustic dish.

Your eyes will instantly be drawn towards a blue spot formed by Lake Arnon nestling in a dark green forest. Feutersoey, Pays de Gessenay and the Bernese Oberland are located beyond this point.  The red roof of Chalet Vieux below stands out from the surrounding green pastures. In the north a path leads towards Lake Arnon. The initially rather steep descent with high steps carved into the ground turns into a beautiful hill path among flowers and butterflies leading towards Retaud and the point of departure."

St\u00f6ckalp is situated in the Melchtal Valley where the gondola leaves for the Melchsee-Frutt holiday and ski resort. The family-friendly village, featuring playgrounds, grilling places and the \u201cFrutt Train\u201d, is located directly on Melchsee Lake, a great place to catch trout and char in the summer. The small Melchsee chapel on the north-eastern shore is a favourite subject for photographers. The next lake on this route is Tannensee (fir lake) below Bonistock. And while it should be obvious from the name - there isn\u2019t a single fir tree in sight. But there are plenty of cows spending the summer on the alp. The path around the reservoir leads to Tannalp. This is where the family-friendly paths end and the more difficult mountain trails begin.  The section leading to Engstlenalp, located in the Canton Bern, offers fantastic views. The area is under nature protection. A scattering of alpine buildings, cows, the mountain backdrop with the glaciers on Mt. Titlis and a wide variety of Alpine flora together create a picture-perfect sight. There is even a hotel on the alp at the end of Gental Valley, the starting point of a number of mountain tours. The trail meanders past the lake and up to Jochpass. The region\u2019s highest mountain, nearby Mt. Titlis, is in view when the weather is clear, as are the Bernese Alps in the other direction.  From here the trail is steep at times and leads down to Tr\u00fcbsee, where a playground and boat rentals are available.

        "description": "On a tour of Geneva, you soon realize that the vibrant metropolis also offers wonderful locations in natural surroundings. Combined with the urban background, the attractive promenade alongside the lake, is the ideal place to take a stroll. The route leads along the west side of the lake, where you cross a bridge and can already gather the first impressions of this pulsating city. You continue towards the east side of the lake and soon discover Geneva's landmark, the Jet d\u2019Eau. The fountain shoots 140 metres into the air and is visible from afar. The Jet d\u2019Eau, with the imposing Mont Blanc in the background and the Cathedral of Rive Droite in the foreground, provides a fantastic sight. Sailing yachts ply the waters of the lake and harbour. You can enjoy the hustle and bustle and the exceptional panoramic views, quite undisturbed, from the attractive, wide promenade. Along the way there are a host of possibilities for refreshments or - just as you please - to simply stop at a quiet spot for a break. The elegant ambiance combined with the romantic lake setting imparts a care-free holiday feeling. Before you reach the destination at Geneva Plage, the route leads along a quieter stretch by the lake, where you can enjoy the magnificent views to the full."

The Vall\u00e9e de Joux with the lake of the same name lies nestled between two Jura chains. With its rugged, unspoilt natural environment, the valley is also known as the cradle of watchmaking. Find out more about its beginnings at the museum in Le Sentier, where this hike starts at the railway station. From the southwestern end of Lake Joux, the route leads through the valley, across the Orbe river and past moorlands.  During the ascent in the middle of woodland meadows typical of the region, the hiker gets a wonderful view of the lake of Joux and the Dent de Vaulion. The gentle slope finally leads to the highest summit in the Swiss Jura, Mont Tendre. Having arrived at the summit, the hiker has now walked about half the distance and now enjoys the wonderful view of the foot of the Jura, the lake of Geneva, the Alps and the whole of the For\u00eat du Risoux, the enormous forest which covers most of the Joux valley.

Great professionalism and respect for tradition are the essential elements that are at the base of the quality and success of the cheeses produced in Ticino.

Descending along the avenue (that during the carnival of Rabadan acts as the stage for the spectacular masked parade) you will see the Postal Palace on your left, built in the '80s by Aurelio Galfetti, author of the   restorations and considered one of the most important architects of the \"Ticino modern school \". The Viale Stazione leads to the Piazza Collegiata where you will see well-restored old palaces and the namesake Renaissance church decorated with an imposing marble facade. From the Collegiata Church follow the arcades leading to the Piazza Nosetto, dominated by the imposing Palazzo Civico (Municipal Palace).  Despite its Renaissance appearance, it was built at the beginning of the 1900s with the material from its predecessor, a 15th century building. Continue along the Via to the Piazza Indipendenza (Independence Square) where an obelisk erected in 1903 stands in memory of the 100th anniversary of Ticino's accession to the Confederation.  Turn right and take Via Dogana where you will cross a segment of the walls before arriving on Piazza Governo, the seat of Ticino's Executive and Legislative offices. The 1800s square is distinguished by the old Ursuline convent, built between 1738 and 1743, later turned into seat of Ticino's Government and now of the Legislative office. At the centre of the square's vast space is a fountain with a seal sculpted by the Ticino artist Remo Rossi (1909-1982). Facing it, the Teatro Sociale, built in 1847 and restored in 1997. Following the Via Teatro under the porticos, you will return to Piazza Nosetto and then Piazza Collegiata. Turn left and walk along the harmonious Via Codeborgo that leads to the Piazza del Sole. Designed by Livio Vacchini (1933-2007), another important Ticino architect, the square is meant to emphasize the rock where the Castelgrande stands. From the Piazza del Sole, turn right into the Vicolo Torre and when you reach the intersection with Viale Stazione, you will be back at the point of departure.  Outside the historic centre, in the vicinity of the cemetery that is easily accessible by car, is the 15th century church of Saint Mary of Graces. Elegant and fascinating, the church preserves a beautiful Renaissance fresco painted on a vast, dividing wall built following a Franciscan tradition. At the centre, the Crucifix, and all around, on fifteen panels, the life of Christ is narrated. The author of this work is an unknown Lombardy painter from the end of the 1400s.  The frescoes dedicated to the Dormitio Mariae (chapel on the front-right), to some Saints (first chapel on the left) and to the Annunciation on the choir's triumphal arch are also of good artistic quality. The church was partially destroyed by a fire in 1996 and after years of restoration the frescoes have been salvaged with an incredible result.  In the cloister of the ex-convent attached to the church, today a retirement home, you can admire an interesting cycle of 18th century frescoes illustrating episodes of the life of Saint Francis.

They became part of the UNESCO World Heritage in 2000.

The Dukes of Milan were the ones to block the valley of the River Ticino. It was meant to impede the Swiss Confederates from gaining ground in the South. This passage, at the valley's narrowing point, is the only access to the North. To access the first castle, Castelgrande, you may take the elevator from the Piazza del Sole or on foot by going up the alleys that begin in the city's historic centre in the vicinity of the  . This castle, like the others, is also accessible with the little tourist train that leaves from the Piazza Collegiata. Castelgrande, that in the 80s and 90s was subject to an accurate restoration directed by the architect Aurelio Galfettti, is equipped with two high towers and crenulated walls that are partially accessible on foot. It houses a museum illustrating the history of the city as well as temporary exhibits, and a good restaurant managed by the Canton Ticino Tourism School. The site on which Castelgrande stands is rich in history and archaeological findings unearthed during excavations in 1984-85 confirm that the site was inhabited as far back as the Neolithic period (5500-5000 B.C.) and date back to Roman times. Excavations in 1967 brought to light evidence of the first fortification from the 4th century A.C. Documents dating from the 6th century. also mention the existence of this first defensive construction. The castle as we see it today was built in various stages and has undergone several restorations. The castle construction began in the 13th century; it was enlarged in 1473-86 and later restored in the 17th and 19th centuries. The White and Black Tower date from the 13th and 14th centuries and are respectiverly 27 and 28 meters high.  Architect Mr. Aurelio Galfetti carried out the latest extensive restorations in 1984-1991. The inner courtyard, the entrances, the elevator and the steps leading down to the town center are a stunning exemplification of the castle\u2019s transformation.  The battlements are divided into three sections, one of which still descends right into the town center. At the time of the Visconti, this remaining bulwark reached down as far as the river Ticino. It was built in the late 14th century and fortified by the Sforza dukes of Milan between 1486 and 1489. In 1515 parts of the wall were destroyed by a terrible flood. The elengance of the 27-metre-high White Tower (1250-1350) and the impressiveness of the 28-metre-high Black Tower (1310) are also worth mentioning. In the Black Tower you can play with an amusing \"Escape Room\" dedicated to the Rabadan Carnival, Bellinzona's historic event, which is one of Switzerland's largest carnival events. From Castelgrande you can reach the castle of Montebello, located on the opposite hill, by descending the stairway leading to Piazza Collegiata and ascending the alley adjacent the namesake church. This castle also houses a history and archaeology museum. Montebello is the name of the hill on which the castle stands, 90 meters above Castelgrande. The defensive walls of the old town originate here and join up with those from San Michele hill. There are still parts of both branches of these walls protecting the north and south sides of the fortress. The internal nucleus of the castle dates back to the 13th/14th century and has been restored several times. Most probably, it was built by the Rusca family of Como who kept it for a long period of time, even during the rule of the Viscontis. The external courtyards with the towers and the \"Rivellino\" were built by Sforza-engineers in the second half of the 15th century During Swiss occupation, the castle was called Castello di Svitto but it was renamed Castello di San Martino when Ticino became an independent canton. Towards the end of the 18th century, the castle was acquired by the Ghiringhelli family who ceded it to the Canton in 1903 on the occasion of the first centenary of independence.  Inside this castle, an interesting archeological itinerary (Archeologia Montebello), allows you to retrace the history of the medieval manor, accompanied by a guide in four languages to be downloaded on smartphone. The third castle, Sasso Corbaro, dominates the city from above enjoying a spectacular view. It can be reached both from Montebello by following the stretches of trails through the vineyards and the stretches of road, accessible also by car. It houses exhibition halls and an excellent restaurant.  The Sforzas built the third castle, called Sasso Corbaro after the hill on which it stands, in 1479 after the defeat of the Milanese troops at the Battle of Giornico. It was designed and completed in the incredibly brief time of 6 months by the military engineer Benedetto Ferrini of Florence who died of the plague shortly before its completion. Its dominant position, 230 meters above the town, meant better protection of the Ticino Valley. The Castle, starkly geometrical in shape, stands in a square courtyard enclosed by high walls which are as much as 7 meters thick at the point where they join the keep on the northern side. In the square courtyard enclosed by high walls is the donjon (or keep) with its mighty walls reaching 7 metres in thickness. The lookout tower on the southern side is still almost intact. During early Swiss occupation, the castle was known as the Castle of Unterwalden but was renamed Castle of Santa Barbara in 1818. Today it is called Sasso Corbaro or Castello di Cima. It was abandoned in 1798 and started to deteriorate. It would have fallen into complete disrepair had the Canton not interceded in 1870, handing it over to an organization, which planned to turn it into a hotel, and later to three Bellinzona-families who transformed it into a summer residence. In 1919, the state regained possession of the castle and began a restoration that included the rebuilding of the \"Rivellino\" (or outer courtyard), the entrance gates, the 17th century chapel and the well.  \n                                ",

They became part of the UNESCO World Heritage in 2000. A visit to the castles, also connected by a tourist train, is like diving into history: an excursion enjoyed by all ages thanks to the splendor of the fortifications with their high towers and crenulated walls.

The Dukes of Milan were the ones to block the valley of the River Ticino. It was meant to impede the Swiss Confederates from gaining ground in the South. This passage, at the valley's narrowing point, is the only access to the North. To access the first castle, Castelgrande, you may take the elevator from the Piazza del Sole or on foot by going up the alleys that begin in the city's historic centre in the vicinity of the  . This castle, like the others, is also accessible with the little tourist train that leaves from the Piazza Collegiata. Castelgrande, that in the 80s and 90s was subject to an accurate restoration directed by the architect Aurelio Galfettti, is equipped with two high towers and crenulated walls that are partially accessible on foot.

Lavertezzo is world-famous \u2013 not least thanks to social media \u2013 for its Ponte dei Salti, also known as the Roman Bridge. It leads in a double arch over the Verzasca. However, the stone bridge was only constructed after the Roman period in the Middle Ages and rebuilt in 1960 after its partial destruction. After crossing the famous bridge, the route continues through a beautiful forest, always close to the Verzasca. Ticino's Verzasca Valley is unspoilt and partly rugged, boasting many waterfalls and steep slopes. In summer, the crystal-clear and emerald-green water invites you to swim. At Ponte di Corippo, you leave the riverbank and climb up to the village. Corippo was included in the Federal Inventory of Protected Heritage Sites. Narrow alleys connect the stone houses in the village centre, and the centre of what was once the smallest village in Switzerland remains preserved today. A visit is certainly worthwhile. The ascent to Mergoscia, with views of the valley, comes next. The path between the villages of Corippo and Mergoscia was already mentioned in 1741 as a mule track. It's an impressive stretch with many vantage points \u2013 including the reservoir with the famous dam wall.

St. Moritz is located at 1865 m in the middle of the Upper Engadine\u2019s lake area. The world-famous resort originally owed its reputation to the mineral springs, which have been known for 3000 years. The town is the focal point of three cultural groups because of its proximity to Italy, the Romansh language and the predominantly German-speaking population.  This section of the route begins at the train station and leads directly along Lake St. Moritz to the wetland surrounding Lej da Staz. The small high moor lake is relatively shallow and because of its dark water, it is easily warmed by the sun. Its lovely beach makes it the premier swimming lake in the Engadine region.     A gravel path goes gently downhill through the beautiful Staz forest to Pontresina. The forest is part of the ecological Smaragd network that protects the habitats of endangered species of flora and fauna. Large parts of the forest are designated wildlife sanctuaries. After the forest, you follow the Rhaetian Railway to Pontresina. The mountain resort, surrounded by fragrant fir and larch forests, is located in the highest side valley of the Upper Engadine. An attractive path continues uphill through Val Bernina. Accompanied by the Ova da Bernina river and the Rhaetian Railway you continue hiking on beautiful forest paths along the slope to Morteratsch. After hiking about 3 \u00bd hours, you reach Cascada da Bernina where the mountain stream plunges almost 200 meters down into the valley. A waterfall path across wooden walkways and steps leads up to several waterfall platforms, offering views of the Bernina massif and its glaciers. The Rhaetian Railway meanders along this passage (without cogwheel) around tight turns and across historic viaducts.  Further along Ova da Bernina, attractive trails lead past boulders through the impressive mountain area to the Diavolezza gondola station. The gravel path through rocky grass landscapes takes you to Lej Pitschen, Lej Nair and Lago Bianco. Large Lago Bianco consisted of two natural lakes, which were joined by two gravity dams in 1911. Its name stems from the whitish colour that comes from the inflow of the Cambrena glacier. Both, the linguistic boundary between the Romansh-speaking Engadine and the Italian Valposchiavo, as well as the watershed are located at the height of the dam. From Lej Nair the water flows into the Black Sea, from Lago Bianco it makes its way to the Adriatic Sea.  The last section follows after you cross the dam, with views of the bare slopes of Piz Cambrena and Sassal Mason. Thin white-water streams and the Vadret dal Cambrena glacier are visible.

        "description": "Through moorland and Alpine pastures to the Berninapass. One highlight follows another. The Stazerwald forest, Pontresina, the Morteratsch glacier world, Lago Bianco-Lej Nair watershed and Graubunden's highest mountain. St. Moritz is located at 1865 m in the middle of the Upper Engadine\u2019s lake area. The world-famous resort originally owed its reputation to the mineral springs, which have been known for 3000 years. The town is the focal point of three cultural groups because of its proximity to Italy, the Romansh language and the predominantly German-speaking population.  This section of the route begins at the train station and leads directly along Lake St. Moritz to the wetland surrounding Lej da Staz. The small high moor lake is relatively shallow and because of its dark water, it is easily warmed by the sun. Its lovely beach makes it the premier swimming lake in the Engadine region.     A gravel path goes gently downhill through the beautiful Staz forest to Pontresina. The forest is part of the ecological Smaragd network that protects the habitats of endangered species of flora and fauna. Large parts of the forest are designated wildlife sanctuaries. After the forest, you follow the Rhaetian Railway to Pontresina. The mountain resort, surrounded by fragrant fir and larch forests, is located in the highest side valley of the Upper Engadine. An attractive path continues uphill through Val Bernina. Accompanied by the Ova da Bernina river and the Rhaetian Railway you continue hiking on beautiful forest paths along the slope to Morteratsch. After hiking about 3 \u00bd hours, you reach Cascada da Bernina where the mountain stream plunges almost 200 meters down into the valley.

The Wildspitz, the highest mountain in Canton Zug, offers superb views of the lakes of Central Switzerland. The hike begins at Arth-Goldau station, a vital railway junction on the Gotthard line. The twin locality lies between Lake Zug and Lake Lauerz in the canton of Schwyz. A massive landslide formed an alluvial fan some 200 years ago. Today, this rocky, pristine, natural landscape is home to the renowned Goldau Wildlife Park.  You quickly leave the settlement area by heading north through the village centre along the main road. A steep ascent leads across flower meadows and past numerous cherry trees. In spring, the blooming hillsides provide a spectacular nature experience.

Soon after, Lejin Cristal, the first of the six small mountain lakes, comes into view, followed by Lejin Magnetit, Lejin Malachit, Lejin Rhodonit, Lejin S-chaglia and finally Lejin Epidot, all lined up like precious pearls. The craggy faces of the Corvatsch massif provide a stunning backdrop to the hike. There are many places to stop off and rest your legs along the route. The Ustaria Rabgiusa Hut and La Ch\u00fcdera restaurant with its spacious panoramic terrace offer the ideal spot to grab something to eat. The Water Trail is perfect for children and comes with an accompanying \u201cPlitsch & Platsch\u201c booklet. Featuring \u201cFurbaz\u201d the sprite and \u201cMara\u201d the mountain fairy, this amusing tale about the Water Trail will spur on tired legs and teach children useful facts about the six lakes on the trail. The booklet is available free of charge from the ticket counters at the Corvatsch and Furtschellas valley stations."

In the 1930s, the Bannalpsee lake was the source of a fierce dispute over the energy supply. Angel Mountain, as the founders of the Benedictine monastery named the town in 1120, is a popular tourist destination. The appearance of the village of Engelberg is dominated by the impressive monastery and the church. At the current time, about 30 monks still live and work here. Starting at the train station and passing the monastery, the tour soon turns into a test of endurance. It takes around two hours just to get to Ristis. Continuing on a wide road, Brunni Hut is reached in another hour or so. This is probably the only hut of the Swiss Alpine Club with its own chairlift station. It is located at H\u00e4rzlisee Lake. There is a trail going all around the lake, a so-called barefoot path. The view of the mountains of Central Switzerland is spectacular, especially Mt. Titlis, at 3238 m the highest mountain of this region.  The route now changes to a narrow path. At S\u00e4delegg, the last viewpoint in the direction of Engelberg and Titlis, you start walking around the Walenst\u00f6cke. After a little over an hour of pure joy on the trail, you get to Walenalp with a campfire site and a lovely view of the Mittelland region. Climbing up another 250 m in altitude, past the dominant Gross and Chli Ch\u00e4len Mountains, takes you to the magnificent lookout at Walegg, the highest point of the tour. The reward is a fantastic view of Bannalpsee. The path now continues in the direction of the lake located in the midst of gorgeous mountain scenery. After about an hour, the trail crosses Bannalp Creek, which feeds the lake.  Near Kreuzh\u00fctte, which can be reached by gondola, the path turns to the right, heading for Brisen Mountain along the green hillside and through the forest.

The traffic-free, historic town centre and the Mediterranean-style squares and arcades give the town a southern flair.

Schweizertor: Alpine crossing to Brand (A), where the first Walsers settled in the 14th century. The Walser Trail follows the tracks of the Walser people in the high valleys of Graub\u00fcnden in 19 one-day stages, running along historical, pristine hiking trails. The approximately ten-hour hike begins in the Walser settlement of St. Ant\u00f6nien. It's the last stage of the long-distance hiking trail covering around 300 kilometres and 40,000 vertical metres. Past the pretty, late-Gothic church in St. Ant\u00f6nien, the trail leads slightly uphill on asphalt through the lush green hilly landscape. Partnun was settled by Walsers as early as the 14th century and inhabited all year round. Following the Schanielabach stream, you can see scattered huts and houses on the slopes to the left and to the right, the typical Walser settlements. After Partnun, the route continues up the valley on a narrow path. By the crystal-clear Partnunsee lake, large erratics invite you to do some climbing. The small lake is nestled between the limestone rock faces of the Sulzfluh and the Schijenflue.  At the foot of the imposing Sulzfluh, the trail continues uphill to the Carschina Hut, 2,236 metres above sea level. The views from the southern slope over the Pr\u00e4ttigau's peaks are breathtaking. Climbers, hikers and bikers meet at the hut, which has around 85 beds. Those who stay overnight can see the limestone cliffs of the R\u00e4tikon in a silvery light when the weather is clear and the moon shines.  Via a narrow path between steeply sloping meadows and scree, the route leads past the three towers of the Drusenfluh. To the south, they form vertical, up to 600-metre-high walls. At Chilchi, the Walserweg branches off to the right and separates from the Pr\u00e4ttigauer H\u00f6henweg (high-level trail). From here on to the Austrian border, concentration is required. Exposed, over an iron staircase, partly steep and secured with ropes \u2013 the path winds its way up to the Schweizertor. Massive rock formations rise vertically nearby. It's hard to imagine that there was once a customs hut here that was occupied all year round and can still be seen today.  Once in the Austrian Montafon, you hike on narrow footpaths through alpine meadows at the foot of the Kirchlispitzen. Via the Verajoch, you reach the end of the Brandnertal valley, where L\u00fcnersee lake lies. With an area of about 112 hectares, it was once the largest natural mountain lake in the Eastern Alps and is now one of the major reservoirs in Western Austria. It is suitable for fishing, and a walk around it affords fantastic views of the glaciers of the Brandner Valley. The lake, shimmering in brilliant turquoise in the sunshine, was voted Austria's most beautiful place in 2019. A long, narrow dam leads to the Douglas Hut, where you can spend the night. The hike to this point takes about seven and a half hours. It's not for nothing that the descent that now follows is called \"B\u00f6ser Tritt\" (wicked step). You can skip 400 metres in altitude difference by taking the cable car. The path has been cut into the rock, fixed with iron steps and secured with ropes. Along the Alvier, the route continues down the Seetal valley to the tree line. A beautiful forest path leads through coniferous woods.  The hike leads past the Kesselfall. Roaring and foaming, the Alvier flows through a narrow, 40-metre-deep rock gorge. The Kesselfall is easily accessible via footbridges, and a forest road continues to Brand.

The pilgrims\u2019 path finally reaches Lac L\u00e9man and continues on via the Roman town of Vidy to Lausanne. Bishop Sigeric of Canterbury emigrated from England to Rome in 990 AD to receive his episcopal dignity there. He kept records of his journey to Italy. These have been used for the reconstruction of the Via Francigena as it exists today. The fifth stage of the pilgrimage route starts in Lausanne, the second largest city on Lake Geneva and the capital of the canton of Vaud. It was built on three hills and has a medieval old town that is worth a visit. The small, mostly car-free streets with their boutiques and caf\u00e9s are very attractive. The hike begins in Lausanne-Ouchy, which is a popular place for a Sunday stroll among locals and tourists alike. The path to the Chateau d'Ouchy and the ship harbour takes you along the flower-lined promenade. Thirty different types of roses can be admired at the Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Guisan. There is one magnificent garden after another along the quayside: the Olympic Park, the Elys\u00e9e and the Parc du Denantou. Continuing along the shore, Lutry is a little over an hour away, and the first vines are soon to be seen. They form the start of the famous Lavaux Terraces. After Villette, you leave the shore of the lake and climb up the steep slopes. In the 12th century, the Cistercian monks built many kilometres of stone walls, which are still cherished and maintained by the winegrowers today. The grapes flourish on the sun-drenched slopes and enjoy the residual warmth of the walls at night. In 2007, the area became a UNESCO World Heritage site.  On the section to Cully, you enjoy an incredible view across the vines and Lake Geneva to the Alpine chain on the other side. After almost two and a half hours, you are back at the lake. The pretty village with its restaurants tempts you to take a break. After Cully comes Epesses, where you climb back up towards the vineyards. This is followed to Rivaz and St. Saphorin. The charming wine village with its narrow streets and the Gothic church (16th century) nestles on the hillside between the lake and the vines. Further along the vineyards, you soon see the first houses of the municipality of Corseaux, which borders on Vevey. This varied stage ends at Vevey train station just over five hours later.",

Bishop Sigeric of Canterbury emigrated from England to Rome in 990 AD to receive his episcopal dignity there. He kept records of his journey to Italy. These have been used for the reconstruction of the Via Francigena as it exists today. The fifth stage of the pilgrimage route starts in Lausanne, the second largest city on Lake Geneva and the capital of the canton of Vaud. It was built on three hills and has a medieval old town that is worth a visit. The small, mostly car-free streets with their boutiques and caf\u00e9s are very attractive. The hike begins in Lausanne-Ouchy, which is a popular place for a Sunday stroll among locals and tourists alike. The path to the Chateau d'Ouchy and the ship harbour takes you along the flower-lined promenade. Thirty different types of roses can be admired at the Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Guisan. There is one magnificent garden after another along the quayside: the Olympic Park, the Elys\u00e9e and the Parc du Denantou. Continuing along the shore, Lutry is a little over an hour away, and the first vines are soon to be seen. They form the start of the famous Lavaux Terraces. After Villette, you leave the shore of the lake and climb up the steep slopes. In the 12th century, the Cistercian monks built many kilometres of stone walls, which are still cherished and maintained by the winegrowers today. The grapes flourish on the sun-drenched slopes and enjoy the residual warmth of the walls at night. In 2007, the area became a UNESCO World Heritage site.  On the section to Cully, you enjoy an incredible view across the vines and Lake Geneva to the Alpine chain on the other side. After almost two and a half hours, you are back at the lake. The pretty village with its restaurants tempts you to take a break. After Cully comes Epesses, where you climb back up towards the vineyards. This is followed to Rivaz and St. Saphorin. The charming wine village with its narrow streets and the Gothic church (16th century) nestles on the hillside between the lake and the vines. Further along the vineyards, you soon see the first houses of the municipality of Corseaux, which borders on Vevey. This varied stage ends at Vevey train station just over five hours later."

You will initially climb up a large paved mule track shaded by a thick forest. Afterwards, the trail will flatten. In about 45 minutes you will reach Cassina, where a chapel and shelter are located. By taking the trail that climbs to the right of the chapel, in a few minutes you will arrive at the fossil excavation site. Go back to the chapel and follow the yellow signs for San Giorgio.

Particularly visible are the banks of the lake Lugano with Swiss and Italian towns and villages, the Malcantone,  , the Arbostora,  , Rovio and Arogno. For the descent we recommend following the yellow signs for Serpiano, Crocifisso and Meride. The itinerary lengthens by approximately an hour but allows you to reach one of the most interesting parts of the Geo-paleontological path.

Bituminous schist was extracted, a rock that was transported to Meride and from which they would obtain oil and ointment used for therapeutic purposes. But the bituminous schist mines were also rich in fossils. Bernhard Peyer was the one to discover that, with his assistant, in 1907. Hereafter systematic excavations were done bringing to light full animal skeletons of such scientific importance that San Giorgio became known as the \"Monte dei s auri\" (Dinosaur Mountain). A little further along the long trail you will reach another important place for research: Acqua del Ghiffo, where Peyer discovered a large reptile, called   in 1931. As you approach   you will see in the distance the old factory chimney where the bituminous schist was transported and transformed into medicinal oil and ointment. Inaugurated in 1910, it closed in 1950. A little further, another panel introduces the Val Mara where in four different excavation sites fossils of fish, crustaceans, land plants and, for the first time, two insects were unearthed. You can reach Meride in a few minutes and continue the paleontological experience by visiting the Museum of fossils designed by architect  . Through models and multimedia interfaces you can immerse yourself in the San Giorgio of 240 million years ago: a lagoon populated by animals now extinct.

To reach the San Giorgio, you can choose different routes. Comfortable and easy, the one that leaves from the church of San Silvestro in   (if the building is open, take a peek, it's worth it). You will initially climb up a large paved mule track shaded by a thick forest. Afterwards, the trail will flatten. In about 45 minutes you will reach Cassina, where a chapel and shelter are located. By taking the trail that climbs to the right of the chapel, in a few minutes you will arrive at the fossil excavation site. Go back to the chapel and follow the yellow signs for San Giorgio. Walk another 35 minutes - with a final steeper ascent - and you'll finally reach the summit, where a church was built. The view is spectacular. Particularly visible are the banks of the lake Lugano with Swiss and Italian towns and villages, the Malcantone,  , the Arbostora,  , Rovio and Arogno. For the descent we recommend following the yellow signs for Serpiano, Crocifisso and Meride. The itinerary lengthens by approximately an hour but allows you to reach one of the most interesting parts of the Geo-paleontological path. Rich in illustration panels, the trail twists around the Monte San Giorgio and on the Italian side. The first panel you will encounter is number 9 in front of a mine. Pierced at the beginning of the 1900s, it had five tunnels of about 400 meters in length. Bituminous schist was extracted, a rock that was transported to Meride and from which they would obtain oil and ointment used for therapeutic purposes. But the bituminous schist mines were also rich in fossils. Bernhard Peyer was the one to discover that, with his assistant, in 1907. Hereafter systematic excavations were done bringing to light full animal skeletons of such scientific importance that San Giorgio became known as the \"Monte dei s auri\" (Dinosaur Mountain). A little further along the long trail you will reach another important place for research: Acqua del Ghiffo, where Peyer discovered a large reptile, called   in 1931. As you approach   you will see in the distance the old factory chimney where the bituminous schist was transported and transformed into medicinal oil and ointment. Inaugurated in 1910, it closed in 1950. A little further, another panel introduces the Val Mara where in four different excavation sites fossils of fish, crustaceans, land plants and, for the first time, two insects were unearthed. You can reach Meride in a few minutes and continue the paleontological experience by visiting the Museum of fossils designed by architect  . Through models and multimedia interfaces you can immerse yourself in the San Giorgio of 240 million years ago: a lagoon populated by animals now extinct. After the visit, it's worth going for a stroll through the village's alleyways, one of the most charming ones in Ticino, and possibly conclude the day at the Grotto Fossati (Fossati Tavern).

The Museum of Valmaggia in Cevio is a must-visit stopover for those who want to learn more about the valley, and the surprising heritage left by past inhabitants of the area, an example of the ingenuity and resourcefulness of their daily lives. The museum has two exhibition spaces in the old Cevio neighbourhood,  a district comprising bourgeois houses built in the 1500s by the Franzoni families, who co-operated with the \u2018Landfogti\u2019 (representatives of the confederate cantons of which Ticino was a protectorate) for more than two centuries, playing an important political and economic role.

Rather than being created as a repository for the collection of objects, it invites visitors to explore the valley and discover artefacts of museographic interest. These include ice pits (called \"nevere\") for the preservation of milk, snares (\"roccoli\") to catch migrant birds, mills to grind corn and chestnuts, and small stone buildings (\"graa\") used to dry chestnuts. In this way, the headquarters of Casa Cantoni in Cabbio assumes the role of an information centre, where tourists can obtain useful information to discover the area.

The inhabitants of Verzasca subsisted on agriculture and sheep farming, from the middle-ages to the mid-twentieth century. Men, women and children practiced migratory herding which forced them to relocate several times during the course of the year to use the resources of the valley and the Piano di Magadino. The museum, located in a typical Verzasca house in Sonogno, tells the story of the valley also with the aid of a 3D model of the area which highlights the changes that took place in its history and landscape. One section of the museum is dedicated to the emigration of chimney sweepers, a typical trade of this valley\u2019s past history.

These characteristics have endeared it to famous artists and writers. Max Frisch called it the \"homeland of the soul\". Located in an ancient building in Loco, the Onsernonese Museum presents the history, nature and culture of the valley, with a particular focus on its traditional straw-making industry. Developed in the 16th century, this activity engaged the majority of its population until the 19th century. The art of straw-making lives on at the Pagliarte atelier in Berzona, where craftsmen continue to braid straw which is used to create contemporary hats, bags and accessories. An ancient water mill, used to grind different types of polenta flour, is located at the exit of the village of Loco, and is managed by the museum.

Featuring an extensive network of trails (over 500km), this large nature park boasts a rich historical and cultural heritage. The area offers numerous landmark attractions that testify to its life, work and faith. The museum is housed in a monumental, 15th century mansion in Lottigna. Its fa\u00e7ade is frescoed with the coat of arms of the Landfogti, the representatives of three primitive Swiss cantons, who governed the bailiwick (a jurisdiction or area of a bailiff) of Blenio. The permanent exhibition is divided up by themes: agro-pastoral, economy and craftsmanship. One of the rooms houses several examples of carved furniture, produced by the craftsmen of the high valley, while another features the reconstruction of a blacksmith\u2019s workshop and a mill. Other highlights include the old arsenal where visitors can admire images depicting the art of viticulture, and the room of Mos\u00e8 Bertoni, a native of Blenio. In 1893, Bertoni founded \"Guillermo Tell\u201d in Paraguay, an agricultural and scientific colony renowned for its vague anarchic-socialist ideals.

Built by the great realist sculptor Vincenzo Vela (1820-1891) at the peak of his career, the villa was transformed into a public museum after being donated to the Swiss Confederation. From 1997 to 2001 the building was entirely restructured by the renowned Ticino architect  \n                                 The Vincenzo Vela Museum collections reflect the specificity of the home-museum of a man, Vincenzo Vela, who was actively engaged in his time, both as an artist and as a patriot. In the midst of approximately 5'000 works what stands out is his plaster casts gallery, that surprises for its quality and monumental nature and which gathers original plaster models of most of his sculptures. Next to it you can admire terracotta and plaster drafts, that amaze for their fineness and completeness. The inheritance also includes over a thousand prints and drawings of which many by Vela himself, and a surprising collection of old photographs. These (about a thousand) represent one of the oldest collections of Swiss photography.  By Lorenzo Vela, Vincenzo's brother, renowned ornamentalist and animal sculptor, are preserved: a small collection of works in plaster and terracotta, especially animals, and some allegoric and genre figures. By painter Spartaco Vela, son of Vincenzo and donor of the Villa to the Swiss Confederation, many oil paintings in addition to preparatory and academic sketches are present.  The three artists of the Vela family were also collectors of contemporary art of that era, each following their personal taste and taking advantage of their respective friendships with colleagues and friends from the Academy. The three units, converging in the patrimony of the museum, hence form the largest collection of 19th century Lombardy and Piedmont paintings owned by the Swiss Confederation. The family library consists of over 1'500 volumes and can be an interesting departure point for the study of the creative process of many of Vincenzo Vela's monuments. Rightly considered benefactors of their community of origin, Ligornetto, the two most outstanding members of the Vela family, the artists Lorenzo and Vincenzo, came from humble origins. The father Giuseppe Vela (1780-1849) was a peasant, the mother Teresa Casanova (1782-1866) ran a tavern. Like many youth from the Mendrisio region, the two Vela brothers started working stone in the caves of Bisazio, Viaggi\u00f9 and Saltrio. Blessed with a unique talent, they achieved fame in nearby Milan, that welcomed Ticino's youth on the construction site of the Duomo or in the classrooms of the Brera Academy. The two sculptors never broke contact with their native town, demonstrating their attachment through generous gifts to the Ligornetto Commune. Lorenzo was one of the founders of the Societ\u00e0 di Mutuo Soccorso (1889) (Mutual Rescue Society) while Spartaco, the only son of Vincenzo and last direct descendant of the family who died at a young age, followed his father's wishes donating his villa and the collections preserved within to the Swiss Confederation, determining it as the perfect asset to become a museum and fine arts academy. If on the one hand the three artists' faith in liberal politics guaranteed commissions from and favoured attendance of the Italian Risorgimento and progressive environments, both in Lombardy as well as in Ticino, on the other hand their beliefs caused sour hostilities from Ticino conservatives who considered them anticlerical. Numerous are the testimonials of the Vela's presence in the small village of Ligornetto, from the commemorative tombstones to the fountains financed and decorated by the artists themselves. Important for its uniqueness is the grave of Vincenzo Vela in Ligornetto's cemetery, an extraordinary example of a tomb storied by a sculptor. It represents the deceased artist laying down.

The Grand Chavalard (2899 m) is an impressive peak towering over the municipality of Fully in the Lower Valais. This hike circles it at an altitude of between 1850 and 2450 metres. The trail starts at the top station of the Jorasse chairlift, reached from Ovronnaz. After the panoramic ride, you climb up to the Petit Pr\u00e9 where the actual tour begins. From here on, you will cross some magnificent alpine landscapes. At first, there\u2019s a gentle uphill section to the pasture Grand Pr\u00e9 d'Euloi. During the snowmelt season, it turns into a lake.   Now it gets steeper: you have to climb more than 400 metres to the highest point of the tour. The view from the Fenestral pass (2453 m) is all the more spectacular: you look out over the lakes of Fully with the Mont Blanc massif in the background. Immediately after the pass, you reach the mountain hut Cabane du Fenestral. From the top of the pass, the trail first descends past the Lac Sup\u00e9rieur de Fully and the Cabane de Sorniot mountain hut (2,064 m.a.s.l.). The lake is a reservoir and stores the water from the hydroelectric power station near Fully. The power station was commissioned in 1915 - a pioneering achievement! Until 1934, the hydroelectric power station had the world's largest gross drop height of 1,643 metres. On the steep southern flanks of the Grand Chavalard, you have a view of the entire Rhone valley and Fully directly below. Did you know that one of the most exciting sporting events in the Valais takes place on these slopes? The \"Kilom\u00e8tre Vertical de Fully\" is a race run on an unused funicular railway line in which 1000 metres of altitude have to be conquered. With gradients of 60%, the race is considered one of the steepest and fastest in the world. The hike is much more leisurely.

And while you are unlikely to be alone here, you will always find a nice spot for resting and relaxing, whether it's on one of the large rocks overlooking the lake or the green meadows all around. The return leg to the Oberalp Pass takes you past the eastern side of the Pazolastock, where the sweetly fragrant Turk's cap lilies flower in summer."

Start and finish at Les Avants, a Belle \u00c9poque-style village that was one of the first ski resorts created in Switzerland. This thematic walk should be done in the spring (May to June). That\u2019s when blossoming daffodils turn the hillsides above Vevey and Montreux into a white sea of flowers. The area looks as if it had just snowed. As a result, locals also call this rare phenomenon \u201cNeige de Mai\u201d or May Snow. It draws large numbers of visitors to the shores of Lake Geneva every year. A nature trail on the subject of daffodils starts at Les Avants. The village with its air of Belle Epoque is one of Switzerland\u2019s oldest winter sports resorts. Along the path you'll find signs explaining what's around you. This way, hikers can better understand the geology, flora and fauna of the scenery they're passing through. Start walking uphill, listening as you go for the rattling of the Belle \u00c9poque funicular in the background. From Sonloup, the route alternates between forests and meadows, and the views change constantly. One moment you're walking under the Dent de Jaman, next you're going across a meadow looking towards Les Pl\u00e9iades and then a meadow overlooking Les Avants, before reaching a summit from where you can see out over Caux and its palace. There's also a bench from where you can admire the Dents du Midi and Lake Geneva. Half-way through the loop you'll find the Cubly viewpoint, which takes in all these views to offer a 360\u00b0 panorama from the Jura to the Chablais, with Lake Geneva below. Of course, you will also pass several meadows covered with daffodils on this circular trail. Sometimes only a few of them are scattered across the fields. On other parcels of land, they grow more densely.  During the Belle Epoque, daffodils were a symbol of the Vaud Riviera, marking the end of every tourist season. Between 1897 and 1957, this was celebrated with a grandiose daffodil festival, which saw international orchestras performing and flower parades with decorated floats moving through the streets. The festival was one of the first major cultural events in Montreux. Well-heeled winter spa guests and day-trippers would take home boxes full of daffodils. Such a thing would be unthinkable today because there are fewer daffodil meadows. Compared to the 1960s, there has been a 70-80% decrease; as a result, wildflowers are protected.",

The path offers a view of countless landscapes as well as a stunning panorama of the lake and the Jura. Yvonand, located on Lake Neuchatel, is a popular summer destination thanks to its fine sandy beaches, otherwise rarely found in Switzerland. Fortunately, a strip of forest separates the village from the beach, making it a bit easier to resist the temptation of a refreshing dip. With the lake at the back, the start of this hike is rather unspectacular, leading on asphalt through residential areas. After the massive motorway viaduct, the surroundings begin to show their scenic side: an attractive trail winds along the Ruisseau des Vaux brook, lined with steep sandstone cliffs. Situated in a canyon, the nature reserve boasts a rugged beauty both on top of the cliffs and down in the gorge. With a bit of luck, you might even encounter native chamois. Whereas the Vallon des Vaux was covered mainly by oaks in the past, a tree revered by the Celts, beech trees and conifers are widespread today. After following a short section along the Flonzel \u2013 the second brook that formed this untouched valley \u2013 you come to a fork. The described route branches off to the left toward the tower of St-Martin. These ruins were part of the fortification, the only indication of a significant medieval settlement that has completely disappeared in the meantime. Built around the year 1240 and renovated in the 20th century, the tower once served as the residence of the lords. Today, an iron staircase leads to the top of the building, where stunning views over the Jura with its pastures and farmsteads await visitors. The following section leads slightly uphill to Ch\u00eane-Paquier. The local church, built in 1667, is one of the oldest witnesses of Protestant architecture in Switzerland. Its layout is remarkable: a conical roof with turrets rises above the church's elliptical shape.

A peaceful hike through alluvial forest and along the riverbank, ending in the middle of the fortifications of Bellinzona. Biasca on the old Gotthard train line is also the southern portal of the Gotthard base tunnel, the new trans-alpine train link NEAT. Slightly above neighbouring Bodio the trains pass through the 57 km tunnel, which went into full operation in December 2016. It takes just a few minutes to get from the Biasca railway station to the embankment of the Ticino. Hiking along the river is almost effortless. Near Lodrino you change from one side of the river to the other. A huge stone quarry is visible from the path. The quarried granite walls tower high above the Ticino.  Most of the time you won\u2019t even hear the traffic of the motorway or the train track on the hiking path. After a little more than four hours you will spot a rocky outcrop above Claro. This is the convent Santa Maria Assunta. Surrounded by chestnut trees, it has been an extraordinary place of silence, prayer and work since its foundation. Inside, the nuns are dedicating their lives in almost total seclusion to their faith. They sell pieces of embroidery, homemade honey and biscuits and also restore books, all of which benefits the livelihood of their community. After Claro you walk along an industrial area for a while. Excavators, conveyor belts, and tipper trucks transport stone in and out of a gravel plant. A gigantic crane with six arms follows later. This is a gravity power plant. The idea seems trivial and ingenious at the same time: When the energy need is low, concrete blocks are lifted up by means of renewable energy, and when the energy need is high the process is reversed to generate additional energy, similar to the system of hydropower with a dam and a pumping station. A standard tower of 60 meters can store 35 MWh of energy and supply 5 MW to the power grid. That\u2019s enough for 2,000 households. About an hour later you reach Bellinzona. The town is located at the narrow section of the valley, on the southern access route to the Gotthard, San Bernardino and Lukmanier passes. It is probably the most Italian town in Switzerland. The \"skyline\" of the capital of the Canton Ticino with its Lombard character is formed by a powerful stronghold consisting of three of the best-preserved medieval castles in Switzerland.

A standard tower of 60 meters can store 35 MWh of energy and supply 5 MW to the power grid. That\u2019s enough for 2,000 households. About an hour later you reach Bellinzona. The town is located at the narrow section of the valley, on the southern access route to the Gotthard, San Bernardino and Lukmanier passes. It is probably the most Italian town in Switzerland. The \"skyline\" of the capital of the Canton Ticino with its Lombard character is formed by a powerful stronghold consisting of three of the best-preserved medieval castles in Switzerland. It is also a World Cultural Heritage site recognised by UNESCO."

It returns along the Lonza river to Fafleralp with magnificent views of the Lang Glacier. The first section of this impressive hike runs from Fafleralp, following the right flank of the valley (looking in the direction of the river) throughout. Passing the Alpine huts of Guggistafel, hikers reach the delightful Lake Guggi where a bench offers a great view across the lake and the entire valley. The trail continues on a slight incline towards the Lang Glacier. The final ascent is the hardest part of the hike. It is quite technical at times and also rather steep, particularly towards the top. Lake Anen (2,367 m above sea level) beneath the L\u00f6tschenl\u00fccke pass marks the end of the climb. This is also the turning point of the tour. At the Anen hut about 150 metres further on, hikers can take a well-earned break and recharge their batteries for the steep descent towards Fafleralp. Built in 2008, this exclusive mountain hut is of great architectural interest and surrounded by a fantastic Alpine landscape.

        "description": "A glacier experience at the far end of the untouched L\u00f6tschental: this hike leads to Lake Anen and the eponymous hut, which overlooks the entire valley. It returns along the Lonza river to Fafleralp with magnificent views of the Lang Glacier. The first section of this impressive hike runs from Fafleralp, following the right flank of the valley (looking in the direction of the river) throughout. Passing the Alpine huts of Guggistafel, hikers reach the delightful Lake Guggi where a bench offers a great view across the lake and the entire valley. The trail continues on a slight incline towards the Lang Glacier. The final ascent is the hardest part of the hike. It is quite technical at times and also rather steep, particularly towards the top. Lake Anen (2,367 m above sea level) beneath the L\u00f6tschenl\u00fccke pass marks the end of the climb. This is also the turning point of the tour. At the Anen hut about 150 metres further on, hikers can take a well-earned break and recharge their batteries for the steep descent towards Fafleralp. Built in 2008, this exclusive mountain hut is of great architectural interest and surrounded by a fantastic Alpine landscape. The jagged ice masses of the Anen Glacier loom in the background, stretching down like a bluish-white ribbon to the Lang Glacier about 100 metres in altitude below the hut. The eye wanders over the crevices and up to the L\u00f6tschenl\u00fccke pass in one direction and down over the entire L\u00f6tschental in the other.

The stately Au Convent and panoramic views of the Glarner Alps and the valley basin of Schwyz and Brunnen are feasts for the eyes. Less than ten minutes after starting from Einsiedeln railway station, you are on the monastery square, with the Frauenbrunnen fountain in front of the striking monastery complex. It is Switzerland's most important Marian pilgrimage site. The foundation for the Benedictine monastery was laid in 934. There is still a lively monastic community today with much to offer to pilgrims and those interested.  Passing a residential neighbourhood and the industrial area, you soon cross the Alp, an almost twenty-kilometre-long tributary of the Sihl. After a few pastures, you follow the stream to Alpthal. At the end of the valley, you can see the Grosse Mythen; a little later, the Kleine Mythen are also visible. In Alpthal, after about two and a half hours of hiking, the trail branches off to the right. From here, it's a strenuous 45-minute uphill walk. A little above Bogenfang, fantastic views of the Mythen, the valley and the opposite mountain peaks open up.  A short while later, Haggenegg invites you to take a break. The views of Lake Lauerz and Lake Lucerne are breathtaking, as is the sight of Mount Rigi and the much higher Alpine peaks in the distance.  For the next hour and a half, the trail leads, at times steeply, down to Schwyz. After a section on a forest path, the route soon continues on a paved road. It ends on Schwyz's town square after a five-and-a-half-hour hike with plenty of spectacular views.  Between Lake Lucerne and the small Lake Lauerz lies the lively little town of Schwyz. Switzerland owes its name and also its coat of arms to this place. In 1291, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden joined forces to form a confederation and drove out the Habsburgs in 1315 with a victory in the Battle of Morgarten. Schwyz, the capital of the canton of the same name, is home to the Forum of Swiss History, which is part of the Swiss National Museum, and the Museum of the Swiss Charters of Confederation, where the most important covenants of the Old Swiss Confederation are on display.",

Airolo is located in the Leventina district, which geographically comprises the valley of the Ticino river until Biasca, specifically the Val Bedretto and Valle Leventina valleys. The hike starts on the south side of the Gotthard Pass. Until Quinto you are mostly close to the motorway and able to gloat a bit when you look at the heavy traffic on the Gotthard route.

The town is known primarily for its ice hockey club Ambri-Piotta. On the left side of the valley you will notice a funicular railway. With a maximum gradient of 87.8% it is one of the world\u2019s steepest funiculars. It leads to the Lago di Ritom reservoir in the area of the Lukmanier Pass. Cross the Ticino and continue following a forest path to Quinto where you cross the river again and turn into the forest. After the next, fairly short wooded section the lovely hike ends in Rodi.  Before the construction of the Gotthard railway, Rodi was highly dependent on the Piottino gorge. The first path crossing the gorge was built in the 14th century. Later, the Roman Road led from Rodi along the western side of the valley to Monte Piottino and finally down to Prato. The \u201cUrner Saumweg\u201d (mule track of Uri) was not built until the 16th century and led directly through the gorge. This is when the Dazio Grande customs house was built, because the gorge formed the border between Swiss and Milanese territory. For a long time Rodi consisted of only this one building for the transfer of goods. At the same time, it also served as a toll station and customs office. Today, the Dazio Grande is open to guests, offering a country-style restaurant, overnight accommodations and an exhibit about the gorge.",

The town of Aubonne is situated on a ledge above the valley of the same name, at the edge of the Jura foothills, high above Lake Geneva, and it offers magnificent views. Patrician homes, narrow lanes, and a castle from the 11th century portray a picturesque, medieval town. Once you leave the charming little town, you are immediately in the vineyards of La C\u00f4te. This is the largest wine-growing area in the Vaud region, extending across 45 km, almost as far as Geneva. With its hills, rivers and the lakeshore, the region comprises a number of different soil types and great agricultural variety - ideal conditions for both white and red grapes. Here and in the entire Canton Vaud, the Chasselas is the predominant grape.  The hiking trail passes F\u00e9chy, Mont-sur-Rolle, Vinzel, and after almost four hours you are in Begnins. These names are all well known among wine connoisseurs. Out of twelve communities, a total of four have achieved Grand Cru status in an area of 1,900 hectares.  The first half of the long hike is now behind you and you leave the sun-exposed trails and vineyards. The scenery is changing. You walk downhill on the pleasantly shaded Toblerone path along the Serine river to the shores of Lake Geneva. By the way, the name of the Toblerone path has nothing to do with the famous triangular chocolate. Instead, it comes from the anti-tank obstacles that were set up during the mobilisation between 1939 and 1945. The concrete blocks form a 10 km row. They are closely spaced and do indeed look a little like the famous Swiss chocolate. At the end you cross the Le Rancho golf course. This is the last hour of today\u2019s hike. You should definitely plan to spend some time in Prangins. The gorgeous Ch\u00e2teau de Prangins, high above Lake Geneva, is the headquarters of the Swiss National Museum in French-speaking Switzerland. The castle is also home to one of Switzerland\u2019s largest historic vegetable gardens and a French park. Make sure you don\u2019t miss it.

With its hills, rivers and the lakeshore, the region comprises a number of different soil types and great agricultural variety - ideal conditions for both white and red grapes. Here and in the entire Canton Vaud, the Chasselas is the predominant grape.  The hiking trail passes F\u00e9chy, Mont-sur-Rolle, Vinzel, and after almost four hours you are in Begnins. These names are all well known among wine connoisseurs. Out of twelve communities, a total of four have achieved Grand Cru status in an area of 1,900 hectares.  The first half of the long hike is now behind you and you leave the sun-exposed trails and vineyards. The scenery is changing. You walk downhill on the pleasantly shaded Toblerone path along the Serine river to the shores of Lake Geneva. By the way, the name of the Toblerone path has nothing to do with the famous triangular chocolate. Instead, it comes from the anti-tank obstacles that were set up during the mobilisation between 1939 and 1945. The concrete blocks form a 10 km row. They are closely spaced and do indeed look a little like the famous Swiss chocolate. At the end you cross the Le Rancho golf course. This is the last hour of today\u2019s hike. You should definitely plan to spend some time in Prangins. The gorgeous Ch\u00e2teau de Prangins, high above Lake Geneva, is the headquarters of the Swiss National Museum in French-speaking Switzerland. The castle is also home to one of Switzerland\u2019s largest historic vegetable gardens and a French park. Make sure you don\u2019t miss it. Finally, after a long 7.5-hour, 30 km hike, you reach the long-awaited destination of Nyon."

With its modest elevation (1,000 m above sea level), the Br\u00fcnig Pass in the half-canton of Obwalden is the southern portal to the Bernese Oberland, Valais and Italy, and western Switzerland.

Highlights: the Bernina pass with its lakes, the Diavolezza, the flowery Val Roseg, the culturally significant Engadine village of Sils together with views of the Bianco mountain ridge or the Upper Engadine lakes. An unparalleled scenery: this long-distance hike offers impressive views of all the glaciers in the Bernina massif. At 4049 metres, Piz Bernina is the only four-thousand-metre peak in the eastern alps and also the highest mountain in Graub\u00fcnden. On this tour it is circled as far as Maloja. As you start out on the southern side of the alps, you will experience a Mediterranean atmosphere against an alpine backdrop. From Poschiavo with its townscape of national importance, the first stage of the UNESCO world heritage route follows the Rhaetian railway. On the way to the Bernina pass at 2328 metres, you will see the Cavaglia glacier garden with its glacier mills and Alp Gr\u00fcm, offering a first view of the eastern side of the Bernina massif. The pass itself not only represents the main European water divide between the Black Sea and the Adriatic, but also the border between the Rhaeto-Romanic and Italian language zones.   At the Bernina hospice, a breather on the even, wide path along Lago Bianco helps to loosen the muscles. This is necessary, because the second stage climbs all the way up to the Diavolezza top station with spectacular views of Piz Pal\u00fc and Piz Bernina with the legendary Bianco ridge. You can take the mountain railway down to the valley or the trail past the Lej da Diavolezza. Once down, a steep ascent begins on the other side of the Val Bernina towards Fuorcla Pischa at 2835 metres. A jewel right at the start of the third stage: the Val da Fain, known for its magnificent alpine flora and the multitude of marmots. The area around Piz Albris is home to one of the largest ibex colonies in the alps. You descend through the Val Languard to Pontresina, the destination of this stage, either on foot or from Alp Languard by chairlift. After leaving the mountain resort, the trail takes you into the lovely Val Roseg. It branches off in front of the Hotel Restaurant Roseg Gletscher, and you find yourself surrounded by stone pines, larches and alpine flowers with a great view of the Sella and Roseg glaciers. Once you reach Fuorcla Surlej, you can see the lake Lej da Vadret and the Bianco ridge of Piz Bernina to your left. After Fuorcla Surlej, the wide path ends at the middle station Murt\u00e8l of the Corvatsch cable car. The last section is a downhill traverse along the mountain flank to Alp Pras\u00fcra. In the valley between the lakes of Silvaplana and Sils, you arrive at the culturally significant village of Sils with the well-known district of Sils Maria. Past the church of Sils Baselgia and now on the Via Engiadina, the route leads through Grevasalvas on the left side of the valley, where a Heidi film was shot in the 1970s.

Also from a geological point of view this strip of land between  \n                                 Caslano is accessible by car or by   from Lugano. The walk follows the indicated trail, enriched by approximately fifteen information panels. Along the way you will see lindens, elms, ash trees, black locusts, cherry trees, chestnut trees, maples and many shrubs including hazel trees and thorn trees. On Monte Caslano (also called Sassalto) approximately 600 species of plants and 150 types of mosses have been registered . The special position, at the southern edge of the Alps, and the climate characterized by mild winters, sunny summers and rain in the spring and fall, favor in fact an extremely varied flora and a close cohabitation between trees, bushes and underbrush. There are even a few species of exotic plants. The itinerary practically corresponds to the perimeter of the mountain. For security reasons it is recommended not to leave the indicated trail. For those that love good  , the restaurant Sassalto on the hill offers an interesting selection of Ticino wines.\n                                "

The first breathtaking view over the   and   at its widest stretch, can be enjoyed from the square of the church of San Martino, whose interior is decorated with frescoes and stuccoes which embellish the nave and the choir. The cycle of frescoes in the choir, representing the allegories of the months and dating back to 1491-92, is particularly noteworthy.  Featuring closely packed houses, overlooking tiny, narrow streets, Ronco was formerly a village inhabited by peasants, wine makers, (virgola se A.E) and emigrants. Its most famous citizen was undoubtedly Antonio Ciseri, considered one of the greatest authors of religious painting of the Italian 19th century.  Born in Ronco in 1821, he died at the age of seventy in Florence where he had emigrated. The ground floor of his native home, overlooking the square of the church, hosts the Centro culturale Ciseri (an art gallery and gift shop), run by the \u2018Istituto Terapeutico La Motta\u2019 in Brissago.  Those who do not wish to explore mountain paths and trails to reach Pizzo Leone \u2013 but believe us, it is worth the effort \u2013 can settle for a walk along via Gottardo Madonna, a tarred, panoramic road which does not have heavy traffic, and leads from Ronco to   in Ascona. Alternatively, it is also possible to follow a path in the opposite direction, towards the hamlet of Fontana Martina, which has a sweeping vista. The simplest route to reach the starting point of this walk is to set out from Ronco sopra Ascona along the main road, and follow the signs to Arcegno along via Livurcio. After reaching the crossroad at Gruppaldo (marked with a signpost), take the first road on the left and follow the signs to Monti di Ronco. At this point you will cross through a residential area with a breathtaking view over the lake. For a few kilometers the road is fairly wide and easy to cross, only narrowing significantly over the last 2-3 kilometer stretch. You can park the car just after the hamlet of Porera, where the road is closed with a gate. The path leading to Pizzo Leone (1659 metres) involves a two-hour-walk and starts from the small church of Pozzuolo (1181 metres), winding upwards to Alpe Naccio (1395 metres). Before taking the last stretch of the climb to the top, you will come to a panoramic viewpoint with a cross rising up. From this point, the path divides and you can either choose to take the road upwards or to continue on a flat trail at a lower altitude.  We suggest that you take the path going uphill, which crosses through woods and flowering pastures, and enjoy several stunning views over the lake, the islands and the rugged peaks of Ghiridone. In June, when the Alpine rose bushes are in full bloom, the meadows are bathed in a radiant glow of pink. On reaching the summit, you will be met by a panoramic view, not only of the lake but also of the Alpine chain dominated by the imposing Monte Rosa, as well as the charming villages of the Centovalli, in Switzerland, and of the Valle Vigezzo, beyond the border. On your return-journey, we recommend that you follow the same path. Please note: on reaching Alpe di Naccio and before arriving at Casone, we suggest that you take the downward path towards to the small church of Pozzuolo, instead of following the signs to Porera, as this will make the homeward journey longer.\n                                ",

There was a time when the residents of this district could let their livestock graze, gather chestnuts and firewood according to set times and precise rules. Today it's an interesting place from an environmental perspective, distinguished by woods of chestnut, beech, oak and holly trees. The walk lasts about 3 hours. From Miglieglia you reach Monte Lema by cable car. The foot trail descends from the summit to the pasture of Piano Pulpito, continues to Forcola and then goes to Cima Pianca. The first section of the trail, until Forcola, is the most spectacular. You walk between two lakes:   on the right and   on the left. The view reaches on one side until Cannero, with the ruins of the castles appearing from the water, and over Luino, on the other side until the Lugano Gulf and Ponte Tresa. Beautiful all along the way is also the view over the Malcantone villages that are surrounded by greenery.  Through a short deviation from the main track, shaded by century-old beech trees, you can reach a stone building (the  ): an 1853 construction once used to preserve milk products from the pasture. Inside, a small stream would guarantee a steady temperature. Continue down towards Miglieglia and you will arrive in a very special playground with wooden musical instruments awaiting visitor-musicians.

There was a time when the residents of this district could let their livestock graze, gather chestnuts and firewood according to set times and precise rules. Today it's an interesting place from an environmental perspective, distinguished by woods of chestnut, beech, oak and holly trees. The walk lasts about 3 hours. From Miglieglia you reach Monte Lema by cable car. The foot trail descends from the summit to the pasture of Piano Pulpito, continues to Forcola and then goes to Cima Pianca. The first section of the trail, until Forcola, is the most spectacular. You walk between two lakes:   on the right and   on the left. The view reaches on one side until Cannero, with the ruins of the castles appearing from the water, and over Luino, on the other side until the Lugano Gulf and Ponte Tresa. Beautiful all along the way is also the view over the Malcantone villages that are surrounded by greenery.  Through a short deviation from the main track, shaded by century-old beech trees, you can reach a stone building (the  ): an 1853 construction once used to preserve milk products from the pasture. Inside, a small stream would guarantee a steady temperature. Continue down towards Miglieglia and you will arrive in a very special playground with wooden musical instruments awaiting visitor-musicians. In the Caroli area you will instead cross an educational arboretum gathering over sixty species of trees and shrubs found in Ticino's forests. Along the trail there's also a small   (Lumberjack Museum) with the tools and accounts about this profession. For those that like to add an artistic touch to this nice walk, two suggestions are necessary: the visit of the church S. Stefano al Colle in Miglieglia (next to the cemetery), preserving spectacular frescoes; and a walk to the centre of Novaggio, an authentic open-air gallery with murals from different contemporary artists.\n                                "

The first breathtaking view over the   and   at its widest stretch, can be enjoyed from the square of the church of San Martino, whose interior is decorated with frescoes and stuccoes which embellish the nave and the choir. The cycle of frescoes in the choir, representing the allegories of the months and dating back to 1491-92, is particularly noteworthy.  Featuring closely packed houses, overlooking tiny, narrow streets, Ronco was formerly a village inhabited by peasants, wine makers, (virgola se A.E) and emigrants. Its most famous citizen was undoubtedly Antonio Ciseri, considered one of the greatest authors of religious painting of the Italian 19th century.  Born in Ronco in 1821, he died at the age of seventy in Florence where he had emigrated. The ground floor of his native home, overlooking the square of the church, hosts the Centro culturale Ciseri (an art gallery and gift shop), run by the \u2018Istituto Terapeutico La Motta\u2019 in Brissago.  Those who do not wish to explore mountain paths and trails to reach Pizzo Leone \u2013 but believe us, it is worth the effort \u2013 can settle for a walk along via Gottardo Madonna, a tarred, panoramic road which does not have heavy traffic, and leads from Ronco to   in Ascona. Alternatively, it is also possible to follow a path in the opposite direction, towards the hamlet of Fontana Martina, which has a sweeping vista. The simplest route to reach the starting point of this walk is to set out from Ronco sopra Ascona along the main road, and follow the signs to Arcegno along via Livurcio. After reaching the crossroad at Gruppaldo (marked with a signpost), take the first road on the left and follow the signs to Monti di Ronco. At this point you will cross through a residential area with a breathtaking view over the lake. For a few kilometers the road is fairly wide and easy to cross, only narrowing significantly over the last 2-3 kilometer stretch. You can park the car just after the hamlet of Porera, where the road is closed with a gate. The path leading to Pizzo Leone (1659 metres) involves a two-hour-walk and starts from the small church of Pozzuolo (1181 metres), winding upwards to Alpe Naccio (1395 metres). Before taking the last stretch of the climb to the top, you will come to a panoramic viewpoint with a cross rising up. From this point, the path divides and you can either choose to take the road upwards or to continue on a flat trail at a lower altitude.  We suggest that you take the path going uphill, which crosses through woods and flowering pastures, and enjoy several stunning views over the lake, the islands and the rugged peaks of Ghiridone. In June, when the Alpine rose bushes are in full bloom, the meadows are bathed in a radiant glow of pink. On reaching the summit, you will be met by a panoramic view, not only of the lake but also of the Alpine chain dominated by the imposing Monte Rosa, as well as the charming villages of the Centovalli, in Switzerland, and of the Valle Vigezzo, beyond the border. On your return-journey, we recommend that you follow the same path. Please note: on reaching Alpe di Naccio and before arriving at Casone, we suggest that you take the downward path towards to the small church of Pozzuolo, instead of following the signs to Porera, as this will make the homeward journey longer.\n                                ",

Carlo), is one of the most remarkable ones in Ticino. The blissful location, the Romanesque architecture and rich artistic decorations are what make it so unique. Surrounded by fields at an altitude of 850 meters, isolated and facing a cliff that opens onto a vast panorama, this example of Ticino's Romanesque and Lombard architecture preserves a timeless charm. Visiting Negrentino also offers the occasion for a first introduction to the  \n                                 The gracious church is accessible on foot in a few minutes from Leontica by crossing  a modern gangway installed to ease access to this important monument. The keys to access this place of worship are available at the restaurants in the village of Acquarossa. The building, built in the 11th century and mentioned for the first time in 1224, is located on the ancient transit route of the Nara Pass which connects two valleys: Blenio and Leventina. The bell tower, detached from the main body of the church, is probably from the following century. The pictorial decorations cover most of the internal walls and can be attributed to three different eras. The extraordinary fresco located in the counter-facade of the main apses should be original to the church: it represents the Christ in the centre of a game of concentric circles symbolizing the universe that offers him a crown of thorns. Behind him, the tools of the Passion (spear and stick). On either side, the Apostles. Above, a Greek fret interrupted by two lambs and a marine animal. Below, a shoot. A very singular composition that is interpreted as either the Resurrection, the Ascension or the Universal Judgment. The color tones are delicate. The prevailing ones are aqua, okra and brick red. As a whole, it is considered an outstanding fresco with apparent Byzantine influence. The date of work is uncertain (1010-1100) but it is most certainly one of Ticino's most ancient and is often studied by researchers of the great Romanesque paintings of Northern Italy. The other paintings in the oldest part of the church are works of the  , active fresco painters in Ticino and in the Grisons after mid-1400s.

        "description": "\n                                The church of Negrentino, originally dedicated to S. Ambrogio Vecchio (today in S. Carlo), is one of the most remarkable ones in Ticino. The blissful location, the Romanesque architecture and rich artistic decorations are what make it so unique. Surrounded by fields at an altitude of 850 meters, isolated and facing a cliff that opens onto a vast panorama, this example of Ticino's Romanesque and Lombard architecture preserves a timeless charm. Visiting Negrentino also offers the occasion for a first introduction to the  \n                                 The gracious church is accessible on foot in a few minutes from Leontica by crossing  a modern gangway installed to ease access to this important monument. The keys to access this place of worship are available at the restaurants in the village of Acquarossa. The building, built in the 11th century and mentioned for the first time in 1224, is located on the ancient transit route of the Nara Pass which connects two valleys: Blenio and Leventina. The bell tower, detached from the main body of the church, is probably from the following century. The pictorial decorations cover most of the internal walls and can be attributed to three different eras. The extraordinary fresco located in the counter-facade of the main apses should be original to the church: it represents the Christ in the centre of a game of concentric circles symbolizing the universe that offers him a crown of thorns. Behind him, the tools of the Passion (spear and stick). On either side, the Apostles. Above, a Greek fret interrupted by two lambs and a marine animal. Below, a shoot. A very singular composition that is interpreted as either the Resurrection, the Ascension or the Universal Judgment. The color tones are delicate. The prevailing ones are aqua, okra and brick red. As a whole, it is considered an outstanding fresco with apparent Byzantine influence. The date of work is uncertain (1010-1100) but it is most certainly one of Ticino's most ancient and is often studied by researchers of the great Romanesque paintings of Northern Italy. The other paintings in the oldest part of the church are works of the  , active fresco painters in Ticino and in the Grisons after mid-1400s. Depicted in the main apse are classic themes of medieval churches: Christ in \u2018vesica piscis\u2019, the Four Evangelists, the Apostles. In the lower part, curtains conceal the original decoration evoked by the emerging dragon's head. On both sides, Santo Stefano and Santa Caterina. Illustrated below the arch are the King and the Prophets and in the triumphal arch, the Annunciation. Votive paintings decorate the Northern walls including Sant'Ambrogio, a Virgin Mary in a throne, a second Virgin Mary between Saint Anthony the Abbot and San Bernardino and a Crucifixion. Another prolific workshop worked in Negrentino: around 1510 Antonio da Tradate and his aides frescoed the minor apse and the walls of the second aisle. The main thread of the apse paintings is the Life of the Virgin, developed around the central fresco depicting \"Mary's Coronation\". In the dividing arches, the \"Assumption of the Virgin\" assisted by the Apostles and musician angels. Under the arches, Prophets and Saint Anthony the Abbot. Painted on the counter-facade is a scene of Miracle of Parabiagio: Sant'Ambrogio on a horse appears to the Milanese during the battle (1339) to support them. On the sides are illustrated Saints Gervasio and Protasio, two martyr brothers from the first centuries of Christianity.

The centre of the \"magnificient burg\" remains untouched by modernity and becomes especially suggestive at Easter, during the Holy Week\u2019s processions (Unesco World Heritage) and between September and October, when the local wine festival takes place. Mendrisio is the chief town of the region known as \u201cSwitzerland\u2019s Tuscany\u201d,  because of its landscapes, characterized by little hills covered with vineyards, and small villages of brick-houses with shingled roofs. At 5 km distance lays the  \n                                 Our itinerary to the discovery of this remarkable hamlet starts from Piazza del Ponte, distinguished by the imposing parish church of Saints Cosma and Damiano, a relatively recent building (1863-75) by architect Luigi Fontana inspired by Neoclassic architecture. The medieval tower in the vicinity is from the 13th century, proof of the presence of one of three castles that once fortified the city. It was initially used for military reasons and later erected and transformed into a bell tower. In 1908 the tower was returned to its original state. On the square there is also the elegant Palazzo Torriani (Torriani Palace), built over the course of the centuries around the town's first 13th century city centre.  Walk up the Via Torriani (next to the parish church) and Via Santa Maria to quickly reach the church of Santa Maria (Saint Mary), the centre's oldest one. This is a medieval construction erected from the ruins of a Roman villa and rebuilt in the 16th and 17th centuries. The bell tower is Romanesque and dates back to the 12th century. Proceed by taking the Via Vecchio Ginnasio and you will reach the church of San Giovanni Battista (Saint John the Baptist) richly decorated and considered one of the greatest impressions of late Baroque in Ticino. Next to it, the Museo d'arte (Art Museum), hosted by the ancient convent of the Serviti, with a beautiful cloister.  When exiting the museum, turn right and you will see the gracious chapel of the Madonna delle Grazie (Madonna of Graces) that houses a fresco of Virgin Mary attributed to Giovanni da Milano. Proceed down the Via Carlo Pasta and after 300 meters you will see, on your right, the charming Via delle Cantine (Cellar Way). Mendrisiotto is a region with a strong calling for wine-production offering excellent and elegant Merlots. For centuries residents of this part of the city have been using the cool air from Monte Generoso for their cellars, guaranteeing a stable temperature year-round. The majority of the cellars are for private use, but there are still some restaurants where you can taste Ticino's culinary specialties and great regional  .  Go back to the chapel of Madonna delle Grazie and follow Via Stella that leads back to the Piazza del Ponte. Crossing the square, enter the Corso Bello, heart of Mendrisio's historic centre, and walk to the widening where you can admire the magnificent 17th century Palazzo Pollini (Pollini Palace), a typical example of a late Baroque villa from Italy's Lombardy region.  Going ahead on the same road until Piazzetta Borella, taking into Via Gismonda afterwards, you arrive to the architecture faculty founded by renowned Ticino architect Mario Botta. The Academy houses in the imposing Turconi Palace and in the charming Villa Argentina, both dating back to the second half of the 19th century, and inside the more recent Canavee Palace, built in 2000 and which project has been realized by the Soliman & Zurkirchen studio. Covered in black bricks and with its remarkable size, the structure takes inspiration from the neoclassical Turconi Palace, opening through a wide glass-window towards the luxurious park of Villa Argentina, an especially praised green area in the heart of Mendrisio.  Next to Palazzo Turconi, the Architecture Theater was inaugurated in 2018. Also this work, unique in its kind, was designed by the architect Mario Botta, inspired by the ancient anatomical theaters that were constituted by a large central space, where the object of study was placed and around which the students met. The circular building is structured on 5 levels that wind around the central area. During the year it hosts temporary exhibitions and other events open to the public, with the aim of encouraging cultural debate and establishing links between architecture and the visual arts. Tours with audio guides and guided tours to discover the historic centre or particular characteristics of Mendrisio. For information and reservation please contact Mendrisiotto Tourist Office (tel. +41 (0)91 641 30 50 - info@mendrisiottoturismo.ch) There are three important events related to Mendrisio's agricultural and religious roots that take place in the city. In the fascinating narrow streets, on Thursday and Friday before Easter, historic Processions of the Holy Week take place, following a tradition dating from the end of the 17th century. 2019 they have been listed by the Unesco as \"Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\" for the value of a unique event on the world scene, where history becomes spectacle thanks to the living tradition of processions and the \"trasparenti\u201d. These are large translucent canvas paintings, produced and restored using techniques dating back to the 18th century, that hang in the streets, marking the itinerary followed in the evening ceremonies of Thursday and Good Friday: breathtaking and extraordinarily moving in equal measure.  The historic centre is also mirrored at the extremely animated \"Sagra del Borgo\" at the end of September, emphasizing the region's vocation. The most ancient country fair of Ticino's agricultural sector, San Martino, takes place on November 11th around the namesake Romanesque church that stands in a field near the city centre. Downloading an audio guide on the smARTravel application, it is possible to take a journey through time and space, through five art museums of the Mendrisiotto; a territory rich in historical, artistic and landscape features, the place of origin of many artists, architects, collectors and patrons, of which the museums are witnesses.

Old palaces face this street view that is particularly animated in the summer during the musical show \"Moon & Stars\" and the International Film Festival.

The typical pavement of river cobblestones dates from 1825. Start the walk by crossing the entire square to the Visconti Castle. Of ancient origins, it was conquered by the Visconti family of Milan in 1342 and later enlarged. In 1532, after the victory of the Confederates against the Milanese, it was for the most part demolished and from the existing five towers, only one was salvaged. The castle is home of the Archaeological Museum with a remarkable collection of Roman glass found in excavations in the region, including the famous \"bird chalice\". Past the church you should go up the stairway along the western side of the castle that leads to the Citt\u00e0 Vecchia. Once you reach the top, walk along the Ripa Canova to the widening where, on the left, is located the church of San Francesco (Saint Francis) close to the namesake convent. The church's current building, although traditionally known to be from 1316, was built in 1583 with stones from the part of the castle destroyed by the Confederates. The interior of the triple-aisled church, with precious frescoes, was restored between 2009 and 2012. San Francesco hosts numerous Classical music concerts during the prestigious Settimane Musicali di Ascona (Ascona Music Weeks). The adjacent convent of the Friars Minor was transformed into a school at the end of the 1800s. From the church of San Francesco go back to the little square and enter the Via dell'Ospedale. At the entrance of the hospital stands a large bronze sculpture, masterpiece of artist Nag Arnoldi. Turn left in Via Castelrotto that runs along the hospital's modern building and walk to the end of the street. Leading to the main road (Via Rinaldo Simen), turn right and then left on Via Vallemaggia. After a few meters, take the Via S. Maria in Selva on the left where a large gate, also on your left, gives access to the namesake church located in the city's cemetery. Inside the church you can admire precious frescoes from different authors. The most outstanding, from 1401, are works of a not-better-specified \"Master of Saint Mary\" and are considered between the best examples of the international Gothic style in Lombard territory. Located in the central part of the oriental lunette are representations of \"Our Lady of Clemency\" (above) and the \"Coronation of the Virgin\" and groups of Saints, Martyrs and Prophets, located in the ribs of the vault. Other frescoes are works of Giacobino da Vitale (The Virgin's Funeral - 1450), the   workshop (subjects of votive character) and the Antonio da Tradate workshop (Presentation at the Temple). When you exit the church, go back to Via Vallemaggia and turn left. Walk all the way to Piazza S. Antonio where the Baron Marcacci (1856) monument stands erect at the centre. On the square are the namesake church, partially rebuilt in the 19th century, and the Casa Rusca, a noble 17th century house and headquarter of the Pinacoteca comunale (Communal Art Gallery). After crossing the square, take the narrow Via S. Antonio that between antiques and handicrafts stores leads to the Piazzetta delle Corporazioni and then turn left in Via Cittadella, the central artery of the Citt\u00e0 Vecchia. Located here is the church of Santa Maria Assunta (Saint Mary Assunta) - also called the Chiesa Nuova (New Church). Built around 1630, a stucco sculpture representing San Cristoforo (Saint Christopher) decorates the facade. The interior presents one of the most sumptuous Baroque stucco decorations in Ticino. Proceeding along Via Cittadella, at the intersection with Via Panigari you can descend onto Piazza Grande. If you turn right, you will walk through the porticos to Via Ramogna and, beyond, to the train station behind which you can see the Romanesque church San Vittore, that is considered one of the most important ones in Ticino. The current building dates back to 1100 but its bell tower is from the 500s. It is well-known thanks to the frescoes in the central aisle representing scenes from the Genesis: from the Expulsion from Paradise to the Curse of Cain. The paintings, that are better observed with binoculars, are unique for the choice of themes, forms and colors. They unravel along a strip about 2 meters wide and around 20 in length. Dating from around 1140-1150, they are some of Ticino's oldest. Of great value are the 22 capitals of the columns that sustain the crypt, decorated with a succession of geometric and plant motifs, human heads and fantastic animals forming an extraordinary collection of Romanesque sculptures. Behind the collegiate church, on the right you can enter Via San Vittore that descends to the lake. At the end of the bridge above the railway, go down the stairway and under an archway where, just across the way, you will enter the charming Vicolo dei Nessi that leads to the Muralto  Tours with audio guides and original guided tours to discover the historic centre and other characteristics of the town.

The tree and bush garden, created in 1968, is being managed by volunteers. You can choose between several circular paths with information panels.

The panoramic views are unbeatable, extending from the Leventina region over the surrounding valleys and up into the Valais Alps to the west and the Graub\u00fcnden Alps to the east. This high-altitude hike runs almost exclusively along the ridge close to the Swiss-Italian border. The view from the summit of Monte Lema at the start of the hike is truly unforgettable. Lake Lugano sparkles far below on one side and Lake Maggiore on the other, both picturesquely nestled in the mountains of southern Ticino.    These picture-postcard views continue throughout this mountain hike, which includes only two major climbs: one up Monte Gradiccioli and the other up Monte Tamaro towards the end of the trail. For those who would rather avoid climbing these peaks, there are easy alternatives for bypassing both.    The Capanna Tamaro beneath the summit is a must, however. This hut is nestled close to the mountainside and offers up homemade specialities in addition to the views from the sunny terrace. From here it is only a stone\u2019s throw down to Alpe Foppa, a delight for culture aficionados with its Chiesa di Santa Maria degli Angeli, a church designed by Mario Botta. The hike can be completed in either direction. In summer, there is a shuttle bus to take you back to the starting point.

        "description": "The views here are unrivalled: This ridge walk from Monte Lema to Monte Tamaro is a classic amongst the Swiss high-altitude hikes. The panoramic views are unbeatable, extending from the Leventina region over the surrounding valleys and up into the Valais Alps to the west and the Graub\u00fcnden Alps to the east. This high-altitude hike runs almost exclusively along the ridge close to the Swiss-Italian border. The view from the summit of Monte Lema at the start of the hike is truly unforgettable. Lake Lugano sparkles far below on one side and Lake Maggiore on the other, both picturesquely nestled in the mountains of southern Ticino.    These picture-postcard views continue throughout this mountain hike, which includes only two major climbs: one up Monte Gradiccioli and the other up Monte Tamaro towards the end of the trail. For those who would rather avoid climbing these peaks, there are easy alternatives for bypassing both.    The Capanna Tamaro beneath the summit is a must, however. This hut is nestled close to the mountainside and offers up homemade specialities in addition to the views from the sunny terrace. From here it is only a stone\u2019s throw down to Alpe Foppa, a delight for culture aficionados with its Chiesa di Santa Maria degli Angeli, a church designed by Mario Botta. The hike can be completed in either direction. In summer, there is a shuttle bus to take you back to the starting point. The combination ticket can be purchased at participating stations up to 11:30 a.m. \u00a0"

The view across the little Chammseeli lake to the Triassic series on Schn\u00fcerligrat is fascinating. From the Spitzmeilen hut, you can enjoy a fantastic view of the Churfirsten peaks and the Alvier group. The modern refuge was built next to a spring in 1903 with the emergence of the ski sport. It is situated at an altitude of 2,087 metres on the steep slope of the Fetschench\u00f6pf.  The trail leads rapidly uphill on the northern slope to an altitude of 2,204 metres. All across the vast alpine meadows, you encounter occasional snow pockets, streams and boulders. Here you are far away from any civilisation. The panoramic view below the dominant Spitzmeilen peak over the ridges that will be crossed in the further course of the hike is very impressive. The gypsum ridge with its differently coloured rock layers is also clearly visible from here. On the Schaffans plateau, the path leads over yellow-white dolomite rock. It was formed at sea level between 250 and 300 million years ago and is now gradually dissolved by the rain and carried back into the sea. Fascinating channel-shaped formations and depressions in the terrain bear witness to this process. The highest point of the route is reached at the Oxni summit above the Chammseeli lake. At an altitude of just under 2,400 metres, the panoramic view is unrivalled. You can see the Weisstannen valley, the Piz Sardona, the Spitzmeilen, the Churfirsten, the Alvier group and as far as the S\u00e4ntis.  Now the trail follows a ridge across high alpine meadows with partly steep slopes on both sides. With a view over the Pr\u00e4ttigau region and small mountain lakes, the trail continues steadily up and down over Fulegg, past Guli and up to the Madchopf. The main Glarus overthrust is clearly visible on Madfurggl. The distinct horizontal line in the mountain separates the verrucano rocks, which are up to 300 million years old, from the Flysch rocks or limestones, which are 200 million years younger and atop which they are located. Now, on a steep and long descent, more than 1,100 metres in altitude difference are covered. At first, the trail runs downhill just above the Logsbach stream. After crossing the T\u00fcfwald forest, it then heads east to circle the Ringgenstein. The semicircular rock face, up to eighty metres high, gleams impressively on the wooded slope. In wide serpentines and soon on a gravel road, the route continues over the Seez and into the small village of Weisstannen.  The Walser people had settled here as early as the 14th century. Even today, the scenery with the old post office, the village sawmill, the alpine dairy and the rafting on the stream bear witness to the former way of life in the Weisstannen valley.",

        "description": "From the modern Spitzmeilenh\u00fctte (hut) with fabulous views of the Churfirsten/Alvier group through the colourful Triassic landscape of the high plateau of Fans. The view across the little Chammseeli lake to the Triassic series on Schn\u00fcerligrat is fascinating. From the Spitzmeilen hut, you can enjoy a fantastic view of the Churfirsten peaks and the Alvier group. The modern refuge was built next to a spring in 1903 with the emergence of the ski sport. It is situated at an altitude of 2,087 metres on the steep slope of the Fetschench\u00f6pf.  The trail leads rapidly uphill on the northern slope to an altitude of 2,204 metres. All across the vast alpine meadows, you encounter occasional snow pockets, streams and boulders. Here you are far away from any civilisation. The panoramic view below the dominant Spitzmeilen peak over the ridges that will be crossed in the further course of the hike is very impressive. The gypsum ridge with its differently coloured rock layers is also clearly visible from here. On the Schaffans plateau, the path leads over yellow-white dolomite rock. It was formed at sea level between 250 and 300 million years ago and is now gradually dissolved by the rain and carried back into the sea. Fascinating channel-shaped formations and depressions in the terrain bear witness to this process. The highest point of the route is reached at the Oxni summit above the Chammseeli lake. At an altitude of just under 2,400 metres, the panoramic view is unrivalled. You can see the Weisstannen valley, the Piz Sardona, the Spitzmeilen, the Churfirsten, the Alvier group and as far as the S\u00e4ntis.  Now the trail follows a ridge across high alpine meadows with partly steep slopes on both sides. With a view over the Pr\u00e4ttigau region and small mountain lakes, the trail continues steadily up and down over Fulegg, past Guli and up to the Madchopf. The main Glarus overthrust is clearly visible on Madfurggl. The distinct horizontal line in the mountain separates the verrucano rocks, which are up to 300 million years old, from the Flysch rocks or limestones, which are 200 million years younger and atop which they are located. Now, on a steep and long descent, more than 1,100 metres in altitude difference are covered. At first, the trail runs downhill just above the Logsbach stream. After crossing the T\u00fcfwald forest, it then heads east to circle the Ringgenstein. The semicircular rock face, up to eighty metres high, gleams impressively on the wooded slope. In wide serpentines and soon on a gravel road, the route continues over the Seez and into the small village of Weisstannen.  The Walser people had settled here as early as the 14th century. Even today, the scenery with the old post office, the village sawmill, the alpine dairy and the rafting on the stream bear witness to the former way of life in the Weisstannen valley."

        "text": "Ahornen-Rundweg In the Canada-like Oberseetal valley, a family-friendly circular trail with some great views leads through a picturesque landscape with pinewood forests and lush meadows. Lake Obersee, the start and endpoint of this hike, is located in a beautiful valley above N\u00e4fels. Looking across the crystal-clear lake toward the Glarus Prealps, one almost feels like being in British Columbia. The area is especially popular among families and anglers. Along a mountain trail the path initially leads through the Niederseewald forest; after which you cross a spruce forest before the climb on a gravel road leading to the Lochberg. The gently sloping path leads past the permanently inhabited mountain farming heights on to N\u00e4felserberg. Now, without tracks, the path leads over the meadow to the edge of the forest. From there on, a track leads the way on through the woods to the Alp Enziunen \u2013 one of the last two Alps in Glarus, on which Ziger (soft cheese specialty) is still in production. After the alpine meadow, a climb then leads to S\u00f6\u00f6li St\u00e4feli, highest point of the hike. The climb up to St\u00e4feli is well rewarded at the sight of beautiful dry meadows and a large number of diverse plant species. On the other hand, a wonderful panorama overlooking the Wildasyl Rauti Troos \u2013 a large ten square-meter nature reserve existing since 1912 \u2013 and the highest N\u00e4fels summit, namely the Rautispitz, make this a most rewarding scenic journey. The trail then continues, in relatively constant manner, on through dry meadows to the haymaking huts in Geeren, followed by a gentle descent to the \u00abVorder Ahornen\u00bb holiday homes settlement. As you make your way down, here you have attractive views of the Bockmattli, Plattenberg, Schyberg and striking Br\u00fcnnelistock mountains. The further descent is made on the Alpstrasse via \u00c4llenboden with the final stretch before reaching Alp Obersee. Alpine cheese is produced on the Obersee tableland that one can acquire straight from the source (except from July until mid-August, when the Alpine dwellers are on the upper Rauti tableland). Underway you come across numerous information boards and a playground with barbecue. But also at the end of the hike, on the terrace of the Obersee mountain restaurant, you can enjoy a refreshment with wonderful views of the lake.",

From the Heidelpass to the stage destination, views sweep to the Glarner main thrust fault between Ringelspitz and Piz Sardona. Only a few hundred people still live in the village of Weisstannen, where the Walser people settled as early as the 14th century. However, the villagescape with the old post office, the sawmill, the alpine dairy and the rafting on the stream vividly tell of the village's rich history. Leaving the village along the Gufelbach stream, the trail enters the valley on a gravel road between two imposing mountain ranges with impressive rock faces. Soon the path leads into the forest and deeper and deeper into the wild flysch valley Lavtina. Since this is where the hunting ban area \"grey horns\" begins, numerous chamois, deer or ibex can often be spotted.  The path leaves the stream and leads uphill along the western slope, characterised by scree gullies. Beneath the imposing rock walls of the Marchstein, the trail continues up the valley across pastures and through wooded areas to the Bat\u00f6ni waterfall arena. Here, five waterfalls tumble over steep cliffs, and all converge to form the Gufelbach stream. With a height of between 45 and 86 metres, they create an extraordinary spectacle in the Bat\u00f6ni valley basin. Below the waterfalls, the stunning Bat\u00f6ni footbridge gently sways at a height of ten metres over the Gufelbach stream. With wooden planks underfoot and metal nets on both sides, the view on the 51-metre-long suspension bridge is unobstructed in all directions. Now the ascent past the waterfalls gets even steeper and zigzags up to Alp Valt\u00fcsch. Cows graze on the pastures and the terrain is rockier here. However, even at the top of the Heidel pass at 2,387 metres, the pastures are still green. A spectacular view in all directions rewards the hikers. Passing idyllic mountain lakes, the trail now snakes along the southern slope of the Calfeisen valley. Numerous marmot families live here and can be observed.

Highlights include three picturesque Alpine passes, mountain lakes and the Great St. Bernard with its hospice and the famous St. Bernard dogs. The Great St. Bernard has been an important link between northern and southern Europe since Roman times. In the Middle Ages, pilgrims crossed the pass on the way to Rome. Today, the Via Francigena offers hikers a historic tour from Canterbury to that city. The last part of the route described here, including three ascents to passes offering a wide variety of views, follows this historic route. The hike starts at the top of the pass. With the Grand Combin looming majestically to the east, the trail leads over the first pass, the Pas des Chevaux. It crosses the Torrent de Dr\u00f4ne river before winding its way in broad sweeps to reach a path leading to the next pass, the Col du Bastillon. Up here, an impressive panorama suddenly reveals itself, including the Grand Golliat, Mont Dolent, Mont Blanc and other peaks, with the unspoilt Val Ferret down below. The next destination on the hike is also visible by now: the three clear mountain lakes known as the Lacs de Fen\u00eatre, situated on a plateau about 2,500 metres above sea level and flanked by the peaks of the Mont Blanc massif. The carpet of cotton grass surrounding the lakes is a good place to rest and regain your strength for the next ascent to the Fen\u00eatre de Ferret, where the route crosses the border into Italy. This is an aptly named pass: it really does feel like looking through a window at the impressive 3,000 and 4,000-metre peaks, not to mention the historic hospice on the Great St. Bernard Pass. Back at the destination, hikers should allow plenty of time to explore the top of the pass. Highlights include the 11th century hospice, the baroque church and a small museum about the history and natural surroundings of the Great St. Bernard Pass. The undisputed stars of the show are the St. Bernard dogs, bred here by monks over many centuries.

Quite simply, Monte Tamaro is an experience: 360\u00b0 panoramic views on the peak, gorgeous scenery and many leisure activities for families attract a lot of guests in the summer.

It leads through a mill park with the remains of a farming community. Verdasio features impressive mansions while the Ticino\u2019s highest bell tower is located in Intragna. Before a passable road was built in the second half of the 19th century, the only way to get to Locarno from the upper Centovalli was by Via del Mercato (Market Street). The old mule trail was part of the international connection between Domodossola, Valle Vigezzo and the Lago Maggiore.

        "description": "Despite its name, there are no market stands on this trail. The farmers once took their goods across the mule trail in the Centovalli to Locarno. It leads through a mill park with the remains of a farming community. Verdasio features impressive mansions while the Ticino\u2019s highest bell tower is located in Intragna. Before a passable road was built in the second half of the 19th century, the only way to get to Locarno from the upper Centovalli was by Via del Mercato (Market Street).

The St. Meinrads Chapel on Etzelpass and the house where Paracelsus was born are popular resting places, not just for pilgrims. Einsiedeln is situated in the heart of central Switzerland in a pre-alpine high valley landscape. The route starts at the train station, but does not pass the famous monastery. Therefore, a detour to the impressive cathedral of Switzerland's most important pilgrimage site is definitely worthwhile. A first short passage leads from the station through a residential neighbourhood and past the hospital. Then, on the right-hand side, the huge ski jumping ramps catch your eye. The facility comprises 4 jumps, including the longest jump in Switzerland with a hill size of 117 metres. If you are lucky, you can watch international professional athletes during training. You then continue uphill over the Chatzenstrick and descend to Altmatt. Even from the heights of the Chatzenstrick you can see that the valley below is quite special. In autumn, the moor shimmers in brownish-red to golden colours. In the cool, humid climate of the plateau between Biberbrugg and Rothenthurm, high moors and shallow bogs have developed over thousands of years. When it rains, the peat mosses soak up the water like a sponge, and once the sun is back, they release the stored water into the environment. In this way, peatlands act as a natural flood protection. Since dead plant remains do not decompose due to the wet conditions, the carbon they contain is stored as peat for thousands of years and thus binds CO2. After passing the moor, there is a slight ascent up to the Raten. The splendid view over the Aegeri lake and the alps invites you to take a rest after almost three hours. The 7.2 square kilometre lake was originally formed by a glacier. The Battle of Morgarten between the Confederates and the Habsburgs took place on its shores in 1315.

        "text": "Jura Crest Trail, Stage 13/16 Typical Jura: fa river, its spring in a nearby grotto, then a hike along a mountain with wonderful views and lastly two lakes with no visible outlets. So characteristic of the Vall\u00e9e de Joux, cradle of many world-renowned luxury watches. Shortly after the start in Ballaigues, the route crosses the motorway and, a little later, the Lac du Day dam which stores water from the river Orbe. This river has its source in the Grotte de l\u2019Orbe, a stalactite and stalagmite cave that is one of Vallorbe's tourist attractions. The path takes you past Le Day Viaduct, a fine stone arch bridge dating from 1925. Walk along the shore of Lac du Day reservoir until you reach the Iron and Railway Museum. Since the Middle Ages, Vallorbe's deposits of iron ore and reserves of firewood have helped it to develop into a major centre of the iron industry.  Hemmed in between the Dent de Vaulion and the Mont d\u2019Or, the path leads to the venerable station building at Vallorbe. However, the size of this railway station is not due to the town's population: it was needed because the routes between Lausanne, Yverdon and France were historically important. The border with France also lent the town in the Vaud Jura strategic importance and made it a transport hub. Our route out of the centre of Vallorbe leads across the river Orbe. A long gravel track runs uphill through the forest, becoming a steep path just before La M\u00e2che. With the first 400 metres of altitude overcome, hikers enjoy a beautiful view of the neighbouring mountain and the day\u2019s destination. Passing over meadows and a short ridge section, the trail reaches the Dent de Vaulion about an hour later. The region\u2019s highest peak has the whole of western Switzerland at its feet. On a clear day, there are no fewer than eight lakes to admire, most notably the Lac de Joux and Lac de Brenet in the Vall\u00e9e de Joux.

        "description": "Typical Jura: fa river, its spring in a nearby grotto, then a hike along a mountain with wonderful views and lastly two lakes with no visible outlets. So characteristic of the Vall\u00e9e de Joux, cradle of many world-renowned luxury watches. Shortly after the start in Ballaigues, the route crosses the motorway and, a little later, the Lac du Day dam which stores water from the river Orbe. This river has its source in the Grotte de l\u2019Orbe, a stalactite and stalagmite cave that is one of Vallorbe's tourist attractions. The path takes you past Le Day Viaduct, a fine stone arch bridge dating from 1925. Walk along the shore of Lac du Day reservoir until you reach the Iron and Railway Museum. Since the Middle Ages, Vallorbe's deposits of iron ore and reserves of firewood have helped it to develop into a major centre of the iron industry.  Hemmed in between the Dent de Vaulion and the Mont d\u2019Or, the path leads to the venerable station building at Vallorbe. However, the size of this railway station is not due to the town's population: it was needed because the routes between Lausanne, Yverdon and France were historically important. The border with France also lent the town in the Vaud Jura strategic importance and made it a transport hub. Our route out of the centre of Vallorbe leads across the river Orbe. A long gravel track runs uphill through the forest, becoming a steep path just before La M\u00e2che. With the first 400 metres of altitude overcome, hikers enjoy a beautiful view of the neighbouring mountain and the day\u2019s destination. Passing over meadows and a short ridge section, the trail reaches the Dent de Vaulion about an hour later. The region\u2019s highest peak has the whole of western Switzerland at its feet. On a clear day, there are no fewer than eight lakes to admire, most notably the Lac de Joux and Lac de Brenet in the Vall\u00e9e de Joux. Crossing another meadow, we hike downhill to the restaurant before the varied trail runs through the forest to P\u00e9tra F\u00e9lix. It passes by old tank traps and bunkers to reach the shore of Lac de Joux in Le Pont about half an hour later. The water from the two lakes runs off underground, forming the karst cave and tourist attraction of the Grottes de l\u2019Orbe near Vallorbe."

Start and destination is the Cr\u00eat-du-Midi mountain, easy to reach by gondola offering magnificent views. Hidden between Val d'H\u00e9rens and Val d'Anniviers is another unspoiled valley called Vallon de R\u00e9chy.

On the sunny side of the valley along the river Inn, you cross typical Engadine villages, pine and larch forests, crystal-clear streams and lush alpine meadows. The panorama: the gleaming glaciers of the Bernina group and the Engadine Dolomites in the Swiss National Park. The Via Engiadina is a long-distance hiking trail along the entire length of the Engadine. The twelve stages connect the village of Maloja in the Upper Engadine with Vinadi in the Lower Engadine on the border with Tyrol. In parts, the classic high-altitude trail runs through alpine terrain, then back down in the valley along the river Inn. A good level of fitness is a prerequisite for this 160-kilometre multiple day tour. But the fragrant stone pine forests, flowering mountain meadows, foaming torrents, picturesque Engadine villages and the impressive panorama quickly make you forget the occasionally tough ascents.  More than 800 glaciers feed the Inn which rises at the Maloja pass. The Via Engiadina also begins in Maloja. The village at the western end of lake Sils connects the Upper Engadine lake plateau with the valley of Bergell. Above the lake, the hamlet of Grevasalvas is worth a visit. Thanks to its picturesque location and rustic houses, it served as a Heidi film set in the 1970s. On the way past Silvaplana and St. Moritz, the gleaming glaciers of the nearby Bernina group are an impressive backdrop. The numerous cable cars in the area bear witness to the long history of the winter sports resort. Over several stages, the Via Engiadina offers wonderful views as well as insights into typical Upper Engadine villages, including Bever, S-chanf and Zuoz. Here you can admire stately patrician houses as well as traditional dwellings with bay windows and elaborately painted facades.  In the Punt Ota valley, the border into the Lower Engadine is crossed via the river of the same name. One of the most strenuous stages ends in Zernez, the gateway to the Swiss National Park. Along the river Inn, the hiking tour continues on a leisurely and relatively even path via Susch to Lavin. The next village is Guarda, home of the children's book hero Schellen-Ursli. The village is characterised by houses decorated with sgraffiti and flowers. Ardez, Sent or Tschlin are also worth a visit, and so are the valleys: Val Lavinuoz with a view of Piz Linard, Val Tuoi with its many contrasts, or Val Sinestra which has won awards on several occasions for its floral splendour.

On foot: Beyond Lake Neuch\u00e2tel and, further south, Lake Geneva, more than 250 kilometres of high mountain peaks emerge on the horizon. After passing through vast expanses of grazing land, you reach the home of music boxes and music automatons. The long trail passes through forests and rolling meadows, eventually reaching the ascent to the Chasseron. Another glorious view awaits, as is so often the case in the Jura. There is also a hotel and restaurant with views of Lake Neuch\u00e2tel. After a descent of 1.5 hours, you reach St-Croix, the destination for this stage."

Via Windegg and over Sternenegg the trail leads to the top of the Ibergeregg Pass with a guest house and a Lady chapel. The nature preserve located there is one of Europe\u2019s most bio-diverse. Ibergeregg has numerous low and high moors. These received the Landscape of the Year award in 2019 from the Swiss Foundation for Landscape Protection. The 7-peak hike continues gently up and down on a gravel road past the Zw\u00e4cken alpine farm. Locally made alpine products can be tasted here. Via M\u00fcsliegg the trail continues to the next peak (St\u00e4glerenegg), where the path very briefly enters a forest and exits near the Holzegg ski hut. The wide trail with views of the Alptal region passes the Brother Klaus chapel and reaches the peak of Holzegg. The mountain restaurant is located at the foot of the stunning Gross Mythen Mountain, the landmark of Schwyz.

Lovely moorland landscapes on the way through the Schlierental and across the Schlierengrat in the region of the Entlebuch biosphere reserve. The world\u2019s steepest cogwheel railway with a maximum gradient of 48% travels from Alpnachstad to the summit of Mt. Pilatus. Lucerne\u2019s very own mountain was once known as a source of treacherous storms and floods as well as the home of dragons and other monsters. It is said that the mountain took its name from Pontius Pilate, the governor of a Roman province at the time of Jesus Christ. Legend has it that he was buried in the lake at the mountain top. The route starts at Pilatus Kulm. It heads down to the valley and offers a magnificent view across the lakes of Central Switzerland, the city of Lucerne and countless mountain peaks. Within about a two-hour walk, it descends approximately 1000 meters in altitude, first on a steep path followed by a gravel road and surrounded by craggy mountain cliffs and blossoming meadows.  After L\u00fctholdsmatt the route goes gently uphill again. A broad gravel road leads to W\u00e4ngen where it briefly changes to a path. Taking a look behind you now and then, toward the start of today\u2019s tour and to Stanserhorn Mountain on the other side, is well worth it. After hiking more than four hours, an attractive two-hour section starts at Chr\u00fczliegg and continues to Schlierengrat, going gently up and down along the white-red-white trail markers. Through blueberry bushes, past gnarled pines and spruce, some of which have died off, you reach B\u00e4rnerstig, an old crossing to the Entlebuch region.   Next you pass through a fantastic moorland area leading to Schwendi Kaltbad, once a recognized health resort with a sanatorium. It was known for the healing power of its mud and sulphur baths. In the summer, Alpine church services and weddings are held in the small chapel. It doesn\u2019t take long to get to Langis from here, the end of this lovely, but sometimes strenuous hike. Langis is located above Lake Sarnen. It is popular with cross-country skiers as well as winter and snowshoe hikers. In the summer, it is an insider tip among nature enthusiasts because of the beautiful protected moor landscape with birches, pine trees and mountain meadows.",

Three lovely mountain lakes are located in a wetland area at the head of the Murg valley. The stage begins at the Murgsee hut surrounded by meadows and mountain peaks. Over rock-strewn terrain, the trail climbs steeply up to the Widersteinerfurgglen at an altitude of 2,013 metres. Here the view opens up over the Sernftal valley. The trail now heads downhill again through the rocky and steep Widersteiner Loch. Below B\u00fctzistock and Heustock, the southern slope is crossed on a high-level path with a magnificent view of the Glarus and Graub\u00fcnden alps. You descend on a narrow path and later on a solid gravel road in steady ups and downs and briefly pass the tree line. After the ski hut at an altitude of 1,759 metres, the trail heads uphill again. Below the path, the slope drops steeply and the M\u00fchlebach stream plunges deep down into the valley. After crossing the M\u00fchlebach stream, the trail continues uphill on a narrow path across lush meadows. There are more boulders in the pastures now as the highest point of the route approaches. The huge mountain formations are visible from here, and steep scree slopes and tiny mountain lakes fringe the path. On the Wissmeilen pass at an altitude of 2,416 metres, a magnificent panorama opens up from the Alvier to the Piz Sardona, the namesake of the World Natural Heritage Site. One of the most spectacular phenomena of the UNESCO World Heritage Tectonic Arena Sardona is the Glarus main overthrust. A line visible from afar, running horizontally through the mountain range, separates rocks up to 300 million years old from younger rocks. Far below the earth's surface at that time, the older rock layers have pushed onto the younger rock layers and today lie as peaks atop the mountain range. This and other geophenomena make the history of the formation of the mountains in this area tangible at first hand. Now the route continues downhill for another 470 metres to the destination of the stage. The trail leads past the Verrucano rock which is known for its great diversity in colour. The Madseeli lake invites you to take a refreshing dip before you reach the Spitzmeilen hut a little later. With the growing popularity of skiing, it was built next to a spring in 1903. Situated on the steep slope of the Fetschench\u00f6pf at an altitude of 2,087 metres, it offers a fantastic view over the Sargans region and as far as the Churfirsten peaks.",

The population christened the anti-tank blocks \u00abToblerones\u00bb because their shape recalls a Swiss chocolate brand. Its name might suggest otherwise, but the Toblerone Trail will appeal more to history-lovers than those with a sweet tooth. \"Toblerones\" was the popular name for the tank traps set up as defensive lines between Bassins and Nyon in the second world war. Their triangular shape recalls the \"peaks\" of a Toblerone chocolate bar, and that explains the name given to the 3,000 or so concrete triangles \u2013 each as tall as a man. The \"Toblerones\" are arrayed along a stretch of about ten kilometers between the Jura foothills and Lake Geneva. An educational trail focusing on history follows the traps. Around 1940, when German troops were attacking neutral countries such as Belgium and Norway, fears also reached very high levels in Switzerland. This prompted the start of construction work on the \"Promenthouse Defence Line\": chunks of concrete were set up one after another along the courses of rivers and streams. Instead of removing them again, some were restored as a reminder of the war's importance for Switzerland. But military history is only one interesting aspect of the hike along these \"Toblerones\". This is also a paradise for nature-lovers: the massive tank traps tend to prevent intensive cultivation of the land, so they are now wreathed in moss and ivy \u2013 a welcoming habitat for many plants and animals. Birds chirrup along the streams and above the canopy of greenery. From the fields, you can admire the views of Lake Geneva and the French Alps.  There are also some fascinating buildings along the way, such as the Villa Rose near Gland (a listed monument). This two-storey building is painted pale pink with green shutters. But Villa Rose is not a cosy home: in fact, it is an ingeniously designed fortress. The windows turn out to be fake, and even the toilet has disguised slits for shooting at the enemy! On reaching the shore of Lake Geneva, the route crosses the golf course of the Domaine Imp\u00e9rial club. There is an air of grandeur about the clubhouse here. No wonder: Napoleon's family once used it as a villa. The beach near Prangins brings this outing to an enchanting conclusion.

Birds chirrup along the streams and above the canopy of greenery. From the fields, you can admire the views of Lake Geneva and the French Alps.  There are also some fascinating buildings along the way, such as the Villa Rose near Gland (a listed monument). This two-storey building is painted pale pink with green shutters. But Villa Rose is not a cosy home: in fact, it is an ingeniously designed fortress. The windows turn out to be fake, and even the toilet has disguised slits for shooting at the enemy! On reaching the shore of Lake Geneva, the route crosses the golf course of the Domaine Imp\u00e9rial club. There is an air of grandeur about the clubhouse here. No wonder: Napoleon's family once used it as a villa. The beach near Prangins brings this outing to an enchanting conclusion. A visit to the Swiss National Museum in Prangins Castle is also worthwhile \u2013 and, of course, a stroll through the pretty historic centre of Nyon, overlooked by the towers of Nyon castle."

The sights from the 374 meter pedestrian suspension bridge high above the Laui ravine come with an adrenalin kick. Rothenthurm is located in a high valley with an extensive moor landscape, including Switzerland\u2019s largest existing high moor. The name Rothenthurm comes from the Letzi Tower, built around 1323, with its red shingle roof. Another landmark of the village is the St. Antonius parish church, one of the region\u2019s most impressive. The M\u00e4derenweg starts immediately next to the church. It connects the popular moor path, which ends in Rothenthurm, with the High Trail of Schwyz on Mostelberg Mountain near Sattel. Leaving the last of the village behind, the path heads in the direction of Biberegg. Thereafter, we cross the Steiner Aa River, which flows into Lake Lauerz. This is where the actual climb begins, across meadows and through the forest. The panoramic views along the route are amazing, as you look back to the village of Rothen\u00acthurm with the peaceful Biberegg hamlet and across the high moor, into the Aegeri Valley with the lake of the same name, toward the Morgarten hills and the Wildspitz and Rossberg mountains. The Rigi massif, Mt. Pilatus and the Alps of Schwyz, Uri and Bern are all visible. On a clear day high above the fog, you may even see the Jura mountains and the Black Forest. On the last section, the route dips into the M\u00e4deren Forest. The highest point of the walk is located near the creek where the path descends slightly. The hike can be shortened by a few minutes just before reaching Mostelberg Mountain above Sattel - and this is quite spectacular - by crossing one of Europe\u2019s longest pedestrian suspension bridges. The \u201cRaiffeisen Skywalk\u201d above the Laui ravine has a span of 374 meters at a height of 58 meters.

Formerly the only transit route between the two valleys and the Locarno  area, it was used by people going to market or taking herds to alpine pastures. Intragna and Loco, points of departure and arrival, are two interesting villages featuring well-preserved centres, churches boasting remarkable art works, and two ethnographic museums that bear witness to the past of the two valleys. The route not only offers beautiful views of the area and of the villages of Pila, Vosa and Niva, but also of river Isorno which flows between the gorges.\n                                 \n                                 The walk stretches between two valleys, Centovalli and Onsernone, and runs along one of the finest mule paths in the Ticino area linking Intragna and Loco (\"Via delle Vose\"). Dating back to earlier times, prior to the 16th century, it was very important not only because it allowed the people of the valley to access the   and   markets, but was also used in summer to drive cattle to the   alpine pastures. An easy, often shaded, extremely pleasant route that can be covered in half a day, roughly involving a 3-hour walk (just over 7 km) not counting the stops, which can be numerous as there are plenty of points of interest: well-preserved villages, churches, chapels and museums. Intragna, the starting point, can be reached either by private means or by the   departing from Locarno.  The village is worth visiting as it features a parish church dedicated to San Gottardo that still houses the19th century pictorial decorations of local artists Giacomo Antonio Pedrazzi, Giovanni Antonio Vanoni and Agostino Balestra, the tallest bell tower in the Ticino area (65 metres), and the 16th century \"Casa Maggetti\", home to a well preserved and interesting ethnographic museum. From the parish church, follow a narrow alley leading to the 19th century oratory of the Sacro Cuore, where the mule path of this itinerary starts. After a thirty-minute climb you will reach Pila, an old settlement boasting a charming group of rustic cottages with stone roofs nestling amidst meadows and orchards. A now abandoned school, lying just near to the point where the trail passes, is a reminder that the hamlet once had many inhabitants. The view is stunning and stretches over the village below, to the entrance of Centovalli and Onsernone, over the village of Terre di Pedemonte, all the way to Lake Maggiore in the background. The mule path continues towards Vosa, another ward of Intragna, where an oratory is to be found. In the distance you can hear the Isorno river flowing. Hence the name of Intragna, \"intra amnes\", i.e., between two rivers: Isorno and Melezza. Once you reach Vosa di Dentro, follow the path down towards the suggestive Isorno gorges.  After crossing the iron bridge, which replaced the 16th century stone version that was swept away by the flood of 1978, the trail climbs towards Loco. On the way you will see some porticoed chapels that used to offer shelter to travellers. Niva, with its 16th-century lever press near the river Isorno, is located in an enchanting setting.  The oratory, dedicated to St. John of Nepomuk, the protector of those who cross bridges and waterways, is framed by numerous and spectacular terraced vineyards that have been recovered from abandonment.  The trail then goes from the hamlet of Rossa, before reaching Loco, once a renowned centre of straw craftsmanship. The village hosts an ethnographic museum, which is worth visiting: in addition to the permanent exhibition that shows how people lived in the valley in the past, it also has interesting temporary exhibitions centred on artists and writers who chose Onsernone Valley as their dwelling. The parish church of San Remigio houses the works of an interesting local painter, Giovanni Samuele Meletta, and \"The Last Supper\" painted in 1683 by Gottfried Maes of Antwerp, offered to the community by an emigrant who made his fortune abroad.

The summit is easily accessible from  \n                                 You can benefit from a magnificent view of the Lake Maggiore basin from any point of the Locarno mountain, but the best places to enjoy the panorama are definitely the Cardada landscape promontory and Cimetta's geological observatory. The first is equipped with a gangway that runs through the treetops of the underlying forest leading to a suspended platform that projects the visitor onto a 180\u00b0 panorama with an unforgettable view of Lake Maggiore, the Centovalli and Maggia Valleys. The second, located at Cimetta's highest point, is the geological observatory: a circular platform with a 360\u00b0 panoramic view of the entire region and the surrounding mountains. A red line signals the Periadriatic Seam \u00ac\u2013 a fault along which the mountain chain separates into Northern and Southern parts. Cutting through a great part of Switzerland, the mountain chain was formed millions of years ago as a result of a collision between the Continental European and the African tectonic plates. From the privileged Cimetta viewpoint you can see the Alps in all their vigour and understand how they were formed.  Architecture lovers will certainly not miss the occasion to enjoy the cable car's departure and arrival stations designed by   who has also designed the distinguished water drop-shaped cabins that bring you to the summit in 5 minutes.  Immersed in a magnificent mountainous landscape at a drop of a hat from the city centre, Cardada is also the ideal place to spend some time outdoors with your family. After the fascinating experience of going up the mountain with a cableway, kids can tackle original games, both educational and fun, scattered along the 1.2 km recreational trail through a shaded forest. At their disposal also a small playground with Noah's ark and a big coordinated swing. In the woods between the cable car station and the chair lift there is a massage path where you can walk barefoot. The best way to reach the cable for Cardada is to take the Locarno-Orselina funicular railway, which departure is just a few minutes walk from the Locarno SBB railway station and from the nearby multi-storey car parks.  You can also reach the departure of the cable car Orselina-Cardada by taking the bus FART number 3 at the Lido of Locarno. There are several parking places in the Lido area.   Cardada offers the possibility to engage in numerous physical activities from Nordic walking, to mountain biking, to paragliding and walks such as the climb to Pizzo Trosa. From the Cimetta station, a comfortable and well signposted trail brings you, in less than an hour, to the Trosa Peak by descending to Bassa di Cardada and climbing up through the larches and rhododendrons to the summit (1870 m). The view overlooks an area from the beginning of the Locarno valleys to the Maggia Delta; from   with the   to the Pizzo Vogorno in the Verzasca Valley; from the Magadino Plain to the   and the Denti della Vecchia (literally, Old Lady's Teeth).

The thrill of crossing one of the longest Tibetan bridges in Switzerland (270 metres); the discovery of the Romanesque church of San Bernardo, featuring a number of beautiful frescoes of 14th and 15th century; a visit to the old and beautifully restored housing cluster of Curz\u00fatt, testifying to the time when daily life mainly revolved around hillside activities.\n                                 \n                                 The hike begins in Sementina (Via alla Serta). After having passed through the door of the \"Fortini della fame\" (Hunger Towers), you follow a path that further joins \"Via delle Vigne\". At \"Mond\u00f2 you leave the trail among the vineyards and go up towards San Defendente.  This first part of the walk crosses through a striking hilly landscape carpeted with sun-drenched vineyards, which are cultivated by tree small vine-growers. All of them produce excellent wines.   Located on the beautiful upland of San Defendente is an old medieval oratory of the same name, boasting frescoes of the 16th century. From San Defendente the landscape changes: the vineyards are replaced by chestnut trees, which are to be found all along the trail. Getting closer to the Tibetan bridge, through the thick vegetation, you can catch sight of the  , the San Bernardo Church and Curz\u00fatt.  The Tibetan bridge appears almost at the end of the path, thin and elegant. Of breath-taking, scenic impact, the bridge measures 270 metres in length and is suspended 130 metres above the creek below. A walkway with 728 larch boards, a safety wire mesh on the sides, and a handrail make crossing it much easier and safer. For those who do not feel dizzy, the middle of the bridge is the right place to admire a beautiful panorama including the   Plain, the mountains and, in the distance, the Castles of Bellinzona. After passing the Tibetan bridge the path crosses a pretty arduous area before reaching the church of San Bernardo, a monument of national value. This small Romanesque church stands in a clearing in the woods. Though seemingly isolated, it was once an active part of village life. Its origins date back to the late 11th century. The interior is architecturally simple, but rich in 14th and 15th century frescoes covering virtually all of the walls. The painting of the Last Supper is especially interesting owing to the fact that the artist featured local products, including freshwater crabs and cherries, on the table. Should the little church be closed, you will find its keys a little further, in Curz\u00fatt, either at the hostel or at the restaurant.  The old cluster of Curz\u00fatt, situated at an altitude of 600 metres, lies just a short distance from the church and boasts a restaurant. In past centuries, people did not live on the Plains as they do today, but rather on the hills. This, not only because the Ticino River frequently overflowed, meaning that those living along its banks were at greater risk of contracting malaria, but also to avoid the raids of armies vying for Bellinzona, an important access route to the Alps. The beautiful housing cluster of Curz\u00fatt, with its stone buildings, gardens, and terraces planted with fields of grain and vineyards, has been beautifully restored by the Fondazione Curz\u00fatt-S. Barnard. The restoration was not intended to create an open-air museum, but rather a lively centre that now boasts a hostel and a top-level restaurant. Several buildings, stonewalls and the old mule path have been renovated with other on-site amenities including a delightful playground for children. After the visit of Curz\u00fatt the walk goes on descending to Monte Carasso, crossing through a hilly area carpeted with sun-drenched vineyards, and passing by the church of SS. Trinit\u00e0 and the curious cylindrical constructions named \"Fortini della fame\" (Hunger Towers). Another option is to descend by cable car from the intermediate station in Curz\u00fatt, but there is often a long waiting time. From spring to the end of October, there is a shuttle bus service with departure and arrival at the Infopoint in Monte Carasso. In the morning the bus takes you up to San Defendente's oratory: departure every 45 minutes between 9.15am and 0.45pm. In the afternoon, the shuttle bus bring you back to Monte Carasso: departure at the parking Pairolo under Curz\u00fatt. May and June, the shuttle bus is operating only Friday-Sunday and holidays; from July it operates daily, when the weather is good.

A stroll through their vineyards is strongly recommended and represents a truly enjoyable experience! However, these vineyards are very difficult to handle. Not only are they steep and difficult to access but, in recent years, there have been recurring raids by wild boars. It has been estimated that looking after these vineyards requires almost twice the amount of time needed for those found in the valley. However, their favourable position contributes to the quality of the grapes grown here, which is truly excellent. Constant exposure to sunshine and fresh mountain air means that the grapes ripen to produce several excellent cultivars. At Curz\u00fatt\u2019s restaurant-hostel you can taste the wines produced on site from grapes cultivated in the old restored vineyard (with vines obtained from hybrids of different species) .  In the village of Monte Carasso, just a short walk from the cable car station, don\u2019t miss a visit to the three wine producers of note: \"Cantina Settemaggio\" (by the Marcionetti family), \"Cantina Pizzorin\" (by Giancarlo Pestoni) and \"Cantina I Fracc\" (managed by Christian Rigozzi, brother of the famous, former Miss Switzerland).

In only a few minutes you reach Alpe Foppa at an altitude of 1,530 meters. Here stands the church S. Maria degli Angeli designed by Mario Botta in the 90s. A destination for architecture lovers that appreciate both the firm lines \u2013 that characterize the building as if it were extending towards infinity \u2013 and the painting of artist Enzo Cucchi that adorns it. The Monte Tamaro region also offers a large choice of sports activities ( , sledge course, paragliding, mountain bike) that, together with the restaurant and cultural and natural area, make it and interesting destination for leisure and entertainment. To start the crossing you must first go up to the peak of Monte Tamaro (1,962 m). The ascent takes almost two hours but it pays you back with a beautiful view. This is where a fairly easy up-and-down path begins following the mountain crest through peaks, slopes and pastures, finally reaching Monte Lema in the Malcantone (1,620 m). During the entire trail, the view opens up to the North onto Lake Maggiore, Centovalli, Verzasca Valley, Maggia Valley, Locarno and Bellinzona, while to the South you can sight Lugano with its valleys and lake. Sticking out in the distance are also the most majestic peaks of the Alps, like the Monte Rosa and the Matterhorn. It is an itinerary straddled between Ticino and Italy that lasts about 5 hours and that requires some training, not because of the difficulty (it is classified T2) but for its duration. From Monte Lema you can go down to Miglieglia with a comfortable cableway. Room and board are available at Alpe Foppa, Monte Tamaro and Monte Lema. You should foresee a good amount of water because the itinerary is poor in water sources and streams. The equipment must be apt for a mountain excursion. The walk can also be undertaken in the opposite direction.

During past centuries it was considered a precious commodity and all of its parts were used. Harvesting took place in October and the fruit was either eaten in its natural state or pressed to obtain cooking oil or oil to illuminate houses or churches. The wood of the nut was used both as fuel and as a building material. Nocino is a liqueur that has digestive properties, obtained by macerating green walnuts in grappa, sugar and spices. Dense, aromatic and deep brown in colour, Nocino is also known as \u2018ratafi\u00e0\u2019 because, in the monastic world, when an agreement was signed at the end of a meeting, it was customary to drink a glass of the liqueur saying \u201crata fiat\u201d (let it be ratified). In Italian Switzerland, the custom of preparing a nut-based liqueur appears to have originated at the convent of the Capuchin Friars of Bigorio (Capriasca) who have been making it for over one hundred years based on a secret recipe. The practice of brewing Nocino then spread to other Ticino-based convents, where it was usual to offer visitors a small token glass of ratafi\u00e0. The walnuts were also harvested by friars thanks to the traditional collection of alms by friars throughout the canton.   The population soon began to follow this tradition and still today, in many Ticino households, Nocino is prepared based on recipes handed down from family to family. For several decades, numerous wineries have also prepared this liqueur which is served at grottos and restaurants either to end a meal or as an addition to vanilla or walnut ice cream.  The walnuts that are infused in a distillate must be harvested while still green. According to tradition, the walnuts should be harvested on St. John\u2019s Day (June 24th), preferably at night. However, harvesting can be postponed depending on seasonal trends: what matters is that no woody hull has yet formed (this can be checked using a needle). Numerous recipes exist, differing both in terms of dosage and preparation, exist. Here is one of the many: 1 liter of grappa  8-10 green walnuts 500 g sugar (or less if a more bitter digestive is desired) Spices (cloves, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, \u2026) The green walnuts are left to macerate in the grappa in a large, transparent glass jar with a wide mouth and a rubber seal (like those used for jam).

The thrill of crossing one of the longest Tibetan bridges in Switzerland (270 metres); the discovery of the Romanesque church of San Bernardo, featuring a number of beautiful frescoes of 14th and 15th century; a visit to the old and beautifully restored housing cluster of Curz\u00fatt, testifying to the time when daily life mainly revolved around hillside activities.\n                                 \n                                 The hike begins in Sementina (Via alla Serta). After having passed through the door of the \"Fortini della fame\" (Hunger Towers), you follow a path that further joins \"Via delle Vigne\". At \"Mond\u00f2 you leave the trail among the vineyards and go up towards San Defendente.  This first part of the walk crosses through a striking hilly landscape carpeted with sun-drenched vineyards, which are cultivated by tree small vine-growers. All of them produce excellent wines.   Located on the beautiful upland of San Defendente is an old medieval oratory of the same name, boasting frescoes of the 16th century. From San Defendente the landscape changes: the vineyards are replaced by chestnut trees, which are to be found all along the trail. Getting closer to the Tibetan bridge, through the thick vegetation, you can catch sight of the  , the San Bernardo Church and Curz\u00fatt.  The Tibetan bridge appears almost at the end of the path, thin and elegant. Of breath-taking, scenic impact, the bridge measures 270 metres in length and is suspended 130 metres above the creek below. A walkway with 728 larch boards, a safety wire mesh on the sides, and a handrail make crossing it much easier and safer. For those who do not feel dizzy, the middle of the bridge is the right place to admire a beautiful panorama including the   Plain, the mountains and, in the distance, the Castles of Bellinzona. After passing the Tibetan bridge the path crosses a pretty arduous area before reaching the church of San Bernardo, a monument of national value. This small Romanesque church stands in a clearing in the woods. Though seemingly isolated, it was once an active part of village life. Its origins date back to the late 11th century. The interior is architecturally simple, but rich in 14th and 15th century frescoes covering virtually all of the walls. The painting of the Last Supper is especially interesting owing to the fact that the artist featured local products, including freshwater crabs and cherries, on the table. Should the little church be closed, you will find its keys a little further, in Curz\u00fatt, either at the hostel or at the restaurant.  The old cluster of Curz\u00fatt, situated at an altitude of 600 metres, lies just a short distance from the church and boasts a restaurant. In past centuries, people did not live on the Plains as they do today, but rather on the hills. This, not only because the Ticino River frequently overflowed, meaning that those living along its banks were at greater risk of contracting malaria, but also to avoid the raids of armies vying for Bellinzona, an important access route to the Alps. The beautiful housing cluster of Curz\u00fatt, with its stone buildings, gardens, and terraces planted with fields of grain and vineyards, has been beautifully restored by the Fondazione Curz\u00fatt-S. Barnard. The restoration was not intended to create an open-air museum, but rather a lively centre that now boasts a hostel and a top-level restaurant. Several buildings, stonewalls and the old mule path have been renovated with other on-site amenities including a delightful playground for children. After the visit of Curz\u00fatt the walk goes on descending to Monte Carasso, crossing through a hilly area carpeted with sun-drenched vineyards, and passing by the church of SS. Trinit\u00e0 and the curious cylindrical constructions named \"Fortini della fame\" (Hunger Towers). Another option is to descend by cable car from the intermediate station in Curz\u00fatt, but there is often a long waiting time. From spring to the end of October, there is a shuttle bus service with departure and arrival at the Infopoint in Monte Carasso. In the morning the bus takes you up to San Defendente's oratory: departure every 45 minutes between 9.15am and 0.45pm. In the afternoon, the shuttle bus bring you back to Monte Carasso: departure at the parking Pairolo under Curz\u00fatt. May and June, the shuttle bus is operating only Friday-Sunday and holidays; from July it operates daily, when the weather is good. Ticket office for both the shuttle bus and the cable car at the Infopoint in Monte Carasso.

A stroll through their vineyards is strongly recommended and represents a truly enjoyable experience! However, these vineyards are very difficult to handle. Not only are they steep and difficult to access but, in recent years, there have been recurring raids by wild boars. It has been estimated that looking after these vineyards requires almost twice the amount of time needed for those found in the valley. However, their favourable position contributes to the quality of the grapes grown here, which is truly excellent. Constant exposure to sunshine and fresh mountain air means that the grapes ripen to produce several excellent cultivars. At Curz\u00fatt\u2019s restaurant-hostel you can taste the wines produced on site from grapes cultivated in the old restored vineyard (with vines obtained from hybrids of different species) .  In the village of Monte Carasso, just a short walk from the cable car station, don\u2019t miss a visit to the three wine producers of note: \"Cantina Settemaggio\" (by the Marcionetti family), \"Cantina Pizzorin\" (by Giancarlo Pestoni) and \"Cantina I Fracc\" (managed by Christian Rigozzi, brother of the famous, former Miss Switzerland).  In Sementina, where this excursion begins, you can visit the cellars \"Colli di Sementina\" and \"Azienda Mond\u00f2\".\n                                ",

        "text": "Chestnuts \n                                In Ticino, for centuries, chestnuts were an important staple food for peasants. The harvest would bring the entire community together and was regarded as a special moment, as it guaranteed subsistence for a good part of the year \u2013 its precious fruits were consumed fresh, but also proved to have long shelf life, thanks to drying processes. Although, nowadays, the chestnut plays a secondary role in nutrition, traditions, recipes and lands associated with it are gradually being rediscovered. Chestnut woods are becoming tourist attractions, monumental chestnut trees are being inventorized and new gastronomic specialties are being created.\n                                 \n                                 In rural times, like those of Ticino in past centuries, chestnuts were a staple food. Until around the mid-20th century, chestnuts were consumed up to twice a day, especially during winter. After the harvest \u2013 which took place in late autumn \u2013 they were eaten either boiled or roasted on an open fire. A good part were, however, dried in a room expressly used for chestnut dessication \u00ac (the \"metato\", also known as a \u201cgr\u00e0\u201d or \u201cgraa\u201d \u2013 see explanation below) so that they would last for several months, unless milled into flour. Capable of growing up to 1000 meters in height in sunny areas, nothing was waisted of the chestnut tree: its dried leaves were used as bedding for cattlesheds, while its wood either served as a valuable source of fuel or as building material (pillars, furniture, tools); given its relatively easy preservation, its fruit was used as an emergency food stock. Chestnut forests constituted a precious resource and were therefore taken care of in compliance with specific communal and patrician regulations. Different species were planted in order to obtain nuts having specific characteristics: i.e. sweet, fit for preservation, etc. The \u201cmaronatt\u201d, merchants who sold chestnuts in the city streets of Italy and France during winter, usually began their journey from Ticino.  In view of the socio-economic changes that have taken place over the last century, the gradual abandonment of agropastoral activity and depopulation of the valleys, the role of the chestnut tree and its nuts has changed considerably. The \u201cbread tree\u201d \u2013 as it was known, due to its importance \u2013 is now being recognized as having played a crucial role in peasant culture of past centuries, and experts are beginning to appraise its worth as an important piece of local history. In 1999 the Association of Swiss Italian chestnut farmers (Associazione dei castanicoltori della Svizzera Italiana) was established, with the intent of raising awareness about the history, culture, cultivation methods, consumption and trade of the chestnut, not to mention organizing the harvesting. Furthermore, monumental chestnut trees are being inventoried and several chestnut woods are in the process of being recovered.  Touristic itineraries, including the \u201cSentiero del Castagno\u201d (Chestnut Trail) in Malcantone and the \u201cSent\u00e9e da l\u2019albur\u201d in the Mendrisio area, have been created. Every year, the chesnut plays a signicant role in autumnal gastronomic events and new chesnut-based products are being developed (beer, flakes, marrons glac\u00e9s, tagliatelle, flour, liqueurs and honey). Tourists and the local population gather in October/November for the traditional chestnut festivals that take place in the squares of     and other locations.

        "description": "\n                                In Ticino, for centuries, chestnuts were an important staple food for peasants. The harvest would bring the entire community together and was regarded as a special moment, as it guaranteed subsistence for a good part of the year \u2013 its precious fruits were consumed fresh, but also proved to have long shelf life, thanks to drying processes. Although, nowadays, the chestnut plays a secondary role in nutrition, traditions, recipes and lands associated with it are gradually being rediscovered. Chestnut woods are becoming tourist attractions, monumental chestnut trees are being inventorized and new gastronomic specialties are being created.\n                                 \n                                 In rural times, like those of Ticino in past centuries, chestnuts were a staple food. Until around the mid-20th century, chestnuts were consumed up to twice a day, especially during winter. After the harvest \u2013 which took place in late autumn \u2013 they were eaten either boiled or roasted on an open fire. A good part were, however, dried in a room expressly used for chestnut dessication \u00ac (the \"metato\", also known as a \u201cgr\u00e0\u201d or \u201cgraa\u201d \u2013 see explanation below) so that they would last for several months, unless milled into flour. Capable of growing up to 1000 meters in height in sunny areas, nothing was waisted of the chestnut tree: its dried leaves were used as bedding for cattlesheds, while its wood either served as a valuable source of fuel or as building material (pillars, furniture, tools); given its relatively easy preservation, its fruit was used as an emergency food stock. Chestnut forests constituted a precious resource and were therefore taken care of in compliance with specific communal and patrician regulations. Different species were planted in order to obtain nuts having specific characteristics: i.e. sweet, fit for preservation, etc. The \u201cmaronatt\u201d, merchants who sold chestnuts in the city streets of Italy and France during winter, usually began their journey from Ticino.  In view of the socio-economic changes that have taken place over the last century, the gradual abandonment of agropastoral activity and depopulation of the valleys, the role of the chestnut tree and its nuts has changed considerably. The \u201cbread tree\u201d \u2013 as it was known, due to its importance \u2013 is now being recognized as having played a crucial role in peasant culture of past centuries, and experts are beginning to appraise its worth as an important piece of local history. In 1999 the Association of Swiss Italian chestnut farmers (Associazione dei castanicoltori della Svizzera Italiana) was established, with the intent of raising awareness about the history, culture, cultivation methods, consumption and trade of the chestnut, not to mention organizing the harvesting. Furthermore, monumental chestnut trees are being inventoried and several chestnut woods are in the process of being recovered.  Touristic itineraries, including the \u201cSentiero del Castagno\u201d (Chestnut Trail) in Malcantone and the \u201cSent\u00e9e da l\u2019albur\u201d in the Mendrisio area, have been created. Every year, the chesnut plays a signicant role in autumnal gastronomic events and new chesnut-based products are being developed (beer, flakes, marrons glac\u00e9s, tagliatelle, flour, liqueurs and honey). Tourists and the local population gather in October/November for the traditional chestnut festivals that take place in the squares of     and other locations. In late autumn, in some communes, it is possible to participated in the loading of the \u201cgr\u00e0\u201d.

Dating back to earlier times, prior to the 16th century, it was very important not only because it allowed the people of the valley to access the   and   markets, but was also used in summer to drive cattle to the   alpine pastures. An easy, often shaded, extremely pleasant route that can be covered in half a day, roughly involving a 3-hour walk (just over 7 km) not counting the stops, which can be numerous as there are plenty of points of interest: well-preserved villages, churches, chapels and museums. Intragna, the starting point, can be reached either by private means or by the   departing from Locarno.  The village is worth visiting as it features a parish church dedicated to San Gottardo that still houses the19th century pictorial decorations of local artists Giacomo Antonio Pedrazzi, Giovanni Antonio Vanoni and Agostino Balestra, the tallest bell tower in the Ticino area (65 metres), and the 16th century \"Casa Maggetti\", home to a well preserved and interesting ethnographic museum. From the parish church, follow a narrow alley leading to the 19th century oratory of the Sacro Cuore, where the mule path of this itinerary starts. After a thirty-minute climb you will reach Pila, an old settlement boasting a charming group of rustic cottages with stone roofs nestling amidst meadows and orchards. A now abandoned school, lying just near to the point where the trail passes, is a reminder that the hamlet once had many inhabitants. The view is stunning and stretches over the village below, to the entrance of Centovalli and Onsernone, over the village of Terre di Pedemonte, all the way to Lake Maggiore in the background. The mule path continues towards Vosa, another ward of Intragna, where an oratory is to be found. In the distance you can hear the Isorno river flowing. Hence the name of Intragna, \"intra amnes\", i.e., between two rivers: Isorno and Melezza. Once you reach Vosa di Dentro, follow the path down towards the suggestive Isorno gorges.  After crossing the iron bridge, which replaced the 16th century stone version that was swept away by the flood of 1978, the trail climbs towards Loco. On the way you will see some porticoed chapels that used to offer shelter to travellers. Niva, with its 16th-century lever press near the river Isorno, is located in an enchanting setting.  The oratory, dedicated to St. John of Nepomuk, the protector of those who cross bridges and waterways, is framed by numerous and spectacular terraced vineyards that have been recovered from abandonment.

The village hosts an ethnographic museum, which is worth visiting: in addition to the permanent exhibition that shows how people lived in the valley in the past, it also has interesting temporary exhibitions centred on artists and writers who chose Onsernone Valley as their dwelling. The parish church of San Remigio houses the works of an interesting local painter, Giovanni Samuele Meletta, and \"The Last Supper\" painted in 1683 by Gottfried Maes of Antwerp, offered to the community by an emigrant who made his fortune abroad.

The large \"Parco degli ulivi\" (olive park), which covers approximately 20,000 square meters, is located on the slopes of   and, because of its southern exposure and protection from the winds, it benefits from a mild climate even during the winter. In fact, aside from the olive trees, cypresses, myrtles and laurel oaks the spring presents multi-coloured fields filled with flowers in bloom. The land's steep incline can be overtaken thanks to a stairway and trails that clamber up until they reach the beautiful terracing with views on the lake and the mountains, among which   stands out in the distance. Several educational panels in four languages illustrate the history, botany, cultivation and interesting facts about the olive tree.  The path down from the olive park rejoins the spectacular lakeside promenade, with a splendid view on the Lake Lugano and the surrounding mountains. Gandria is a fascinating village that mirrors on the lake. With its collection of houses, small and large, leaning one against the other, it is worth a visit but not in a hurry. Between alleys and stairways you can discover charming little corners, miniscule terraced gardens and old walls decorated with some frescos. Bearing witness to the importance of the olive tree in the past are many clues: the imposing olive tree ( ) next to the small port and the grindstone that was once used to grind the olives and extract oil, located next to the City Hall. A walk from Lugano along the \"Olive Path\" to the ancient fishing village of Gandria. Return by boat.

For those that are going up for the first time, you will discover a site valuable for its location, history and artistic and spiritual riches. The architectural complex includes, aside from the basilica and the Franciscan convent located at the tip of a sharp-cornered rock, the church of Annunciation, the Via Crucis and other chapels. The tradition narrates that in 1480 brother Bartolomeo of Ivrea had an apparition of Virgin Mary with the Infant on this hill. The population's devotion led them to build a first chapel. In the following centuries the idea of the Sacro Monte arose which is a widespread religious architectural form in the Lake region: an ensemble of churches and chapels located along a course of devotion and integrated into a fascinating and isolated natural environment. The Madonna del Sasso sanctuary, place of meditation and pilgrimage for centuries, is accessible by funicular railway from Locarno to Orselina (Santuario stop) or on foot (approximately 30 minutes). Leave the Locarno porticos and climb up the Via delle Monache and Via del Sasso to the 16th century church of Annunciation. A little further, the street meets a junction: going left leads to the Via Crucis surrounded by twelve chapels with illustrated scenes of the Passion; going right is the trail in the valley. The basilica stands on a vast square where the view ranges over the inner Locarno region At its interior, preserved are the statue of the Madonna del Sasso, a precious wooden sculpture from the end of the 1400s, and numerous ex votos proof of the devotion that bloomed over the centuries around this apparition: painted canvases, oils, embroidery, silver hears. Two masterpieces are the altarpiece the \"Flight into Egypt\" of Bramantino (circa 1520) and the \"Transport of Christ to the Sepulcher\" that Antonio Ciseri of Ronco above Ascona painted in Florence around 1870. Inside the church are stucco and fresco decorations that have reacquired their luminosity after the restoration. Not to miss is the chapel in the courtyard containing the altarpiece of the \"Lamentation\" from the end of the 15th century. Located in the oldest part of the convent, the museum was reopened at the end of September 2016. The museum occupies the original spaces where the four friars lived, including the refectory which houses a magnificent fresco of the Last Supper.  The eight exhibition spaces explore the conventual life of the Capuchin friars and the history of the convent as an integral part of the Pre-Alpine Sacred Mountains. Particularly worthy of note is the largest Ticino collection of ex-votos, mostly dating back to the 19th and 20th centuries, including those of Valmaggese artist Giovanni Antonio Vanoni (1810-1886).

One of the most surprising elements is not only the presence of several of the best known masters of the 20th century but also the quality and the museum-like dimensions of the works.  The second floor is dedicated to temporary exhibits. During 2023 two exhibitions are scheduled: the first one, from March to August, presents the works of Italian artist Alessandro Twombly; the second one, from September to early January 2024, those of Ireneo Nicora, an eclectic contemporary artist born in Ticino. The Ghisla collection is extremely varied both in terms of styles and trends and is distinguished by the multicultural backgrounds of the artists. It represents an interesting example of enlightened patronage. The museum has a familiar feel, almost giving the impression of entering a private home. And, as a matter of fact, collector Pierino Ghisla explains:   The entire collection boasts 280 works of which 80 are displayed. Each year, on a rotational basis, the exhibition is partly renewed, with the addition of new acquisitions. In fact, the Ghislas are continuously in search of new objects to enrich their collection.   \u2013 the collector explains \u2013  An audio-guide is included in the entry fee (chf. 18 adults, chf. 15 (retired seniors), chf. 11 students) and is available to visitors in four different languages (Italian, German, French and English)   Following his retirement, Pierino Ghisla moved back to Ticino, his birthplace of origin, where, with his wife Martine, he fulfilled his dream of sharing the works of their collection with other art lovers visiting their museum.  Aged just 14, Pierino Ghisla left Marolta in the Blenio Valley to visit his uncle who owned a fruit and vegetables import company in Brussels, Belgium. He ended up staying there, only returning to Ticino during the holidays. He continued to pursue and develop his uncle\u2019s business and this activity provided him with the necessary funds to create his important art collection which, he had begun to build in partnership with his wife thirty years earlier, after being totally captivated by a painting by French artist Georges Mathieu.   \u2013 says Ghisla \u2013   \u2013 he continues \u2013  \n                                ",

On the ground floor and of the first floor some fifty works representing the most interesting trends of the late 20th century, are displayed: Arte Povera, Zero art, Informal art, Conceptual art, Abstract art, the New Dada, Spatialism, Graffiti art and Pop art. One of the most surprising elements is not only the presence of several of the best known masters of the 20th century but also the quality and the museum-like dimensions of the works.  The second floor is dedicated to temporary exhibits. During 2023 two exhibitions are scheduled: the first one, from March to August, presents the works of Italian artist Alessandro Twombly; the second one, from September to early January 2024, those of Ireneo Nicora, an eclectic contemporary artist born in Ticino. The Ghisla collection is extremely varied both in terms of styles and trends and is distinguished by the multicultural backgrounds of the artists. It represents an interesting example of enlightened patronage. The museum has a familiar feel, almost giving the impression of entering a private home. And, as a matter of fact, collector Pierino Ghisla explains:   The entire collection boasts 280 works of which 80 are displayed. Each year, on a rotational basis, the exhibition is partly renewed, with the addition of new acquisitions. In fact, the Ghislas are continuously in search of new objects to enrich their collection.   \u2013 the collector explains \u2013  An audio-guide is included in the entry fee (chf. 18 adults, chf. 15 (retired seniors), chf. 11 students) and is available to visitors in four different languages (Italian, German, French and English)   Following his retirement, Pierino Ghisla moved back to Ticino, his birthplace of origin, where, with his wife Martine, he fulfilled his dream of sharing the works of their collection with other art lovers visiting their museum.  Aged just 14, Pierino Ghisla left Marolta in the Blenio Valley to visit his uncle who owned a fruit and vegetables import company in Brussels, Belgium. He ended up staying there, only returning to Ticino during the holidays. He continued to pursue and develop his uncle\u2019s business and this activity provided him with the necessary funds to create his important art collection which, he had begun to build in partnership with his wife thirty years earlier, after being totally captivated by a painting by French artist Georges Mathieu.   \u2013 says Ghisla \u2013   \u2013 he continues \u2013  \n                                "

So the ViaSuworow follows the route of the Russians from Altdorf into the Sch\u00e4chental valley, where cobbled cattle tracks bordered by drystone walling lead to Biel-Chinzig. On 26 September 1799, Suvorov arrived with his troops in Altdorf. The threatening mountains and gloomy ravines faded into the background on the broad valley plain. However, not the entire army had made it to Altdorf, and many soldiers were exhausted from the exertions. Hunger compounded the situation. The supply train had stayed behind, and the French had largely plundered the country.  The fifth stage of the ViaSuworow is, first and foremost, dedicated to Switzerland's national hero, starting at the Tell monument in the centre of Altdorf. The bronze statue, inaugurated in 1895, presents William Tell with his crossbow shouldered together with his son, Walter. After a short walk through the old town and past the industrial area of Altdorf, you reach B\u00fcrglen after about half an hour. The beautiful Marienkirche of \"burgulione\" was first mentioned in a document in 817. The name B\u00fcrglen comes from the Latin burgus (castle). Right next to the church is the Tell Museum. Continuing through residential quarters and along dry-stone walls for another hour, you arrive at Br\u00fcgg.  There was no way for Suvorov to march from Altdorf via Fl\u00fcelen directly to Schwyz or Lucerne. The lake would have been the only connection, but all the ships had been taken away by the French. Therefore, despite overtired troops, he set out for Muotathal the following day. The night of 27 September was rainy and cold. At higher altitudes, there was even some snow. Remarkably, Suvorov ordered his exhausted and starving troops over the pass, given that the equipment, especially the footwear, had also been severely affected on the way to Altdorf.  Today's hiking boots are much more comfortable. For about 45 minutes, the trail leads along the Sch\u00e4chen valley to Gr\u00fcndli, where the occasionally steep 900-metre ascent begins. Scenic paths and cattle trails, partly enclosed by old dry-stone walls or a stile fence, climb to an altitude of over 1,600 metres above sea level. Along the way: magnificent views over the Reuss valley and the surrounding peaks of T\u00f6di, Gross Windg\u00e4llen and Gross Spannort. The stage ends on the sun terrace at Biel-Chinzig. *Background information and quotations stages 55.1-55.9: Alois Camenzind (1992), Maultiere machen Geschichte oder Suworows Krieg in den Schweizer Alpen im Jahre 1799, Luzern: Verlag Pro Libro Luzern GmbH",

On the descent, after the Segnasboden flood plains and moorland, the landscape is increasingly shaped by the Flims rockslide. Elm is situated on the valley floor of the Sernftal surrounded by towering mountains. From here you have a lovely view of the Tschingelh\u00f6rner peaks, the Glarus main overthrust and the Martinsloch (Martin\u2019s hole). Twice a year, the sun shines through this drop-shaped opening in the rock to illuminate the church tower of Elm. Past the valley station of the Tschinglen cable car, the trail climbs up the slope and into the forest. A passage through a deep rocky gorge follows. The path is partly hewn directly into the rock and secured with chains. Here, nature rises grey in grey, oppressive and powerful on both sides. Down in the gorge, the stream cascades over the cliffs several times. On Tschinglenalp, you pass a secluded hamlet and enter a barren, rocky mountain landscape. The main Glarus overthrust draws ever closer. The horizontal line in the mountain shows the dividing line between the 250 to 300 million year old Verrucano rock layer and the much younger layers below. For the last few metres before reaching the Segnes pass, you cross impressive scree slopes on a narrow trail. In addition to isolated patches of snow, sharp slabs of slate stick out vertically on the slope. The highest point of the route is reached at 2,629 metres. The legendary Martinsloch (Martin's hole) is located a few metres to the south. The view at this altitude is truly spectacular. Besides the majestic Tschingelh\u00f6rner and the Martinsloch, the view sweeps back over the steep ridge of the Gandstock and the Mittagshorn to the Richetlipass, Gl\u00e4rnisch, Hausstock, Gross Ch\u00e4rpf and many more. A steep descent follows. The vast grey and white scree and snow expanses surrounded by steep rocky slopes are breathtakingly beautiful. As the terrain slowly turns greener, the geological phenomena that tell the story of how the mountains were formed can be contemplated at close quarters. At Unterer Segnesboden, the trail continues evenly along the alluvial plain. The original mountain valley was filled with debris by the torrents. This created an extremely valuable ecological area with a moor landscape of national significance. Numerous streams flow through the plain in ever new sections, lakes appear and disappear spontaneously. The Upper Segnesboden, also an ecologically valuable wetland, is located in an elevated position to the north-east. The Segnesboden waterfall connects the two areas and flows through a deep rock crevice into the scree landscape on the left side of the trail. From here it joins the Flem, which you follow all the way to the village of Flims. A narrow wooden bridge crosses it on the way to the Segnes hut. The descent is quite varied and follows the Flims waterway to the Startgels cable car station. Soon the first bushes and small trees appear along the path. The view of the Surselva region is terrific. Now you will enjoy some exciting river passages beneath steep rock faces, deep gorges, thundering waterfalls, wooden footbridges over lush grassland, seven bridges, some of them quite bold, bizarre rock formations, steps down a slope, pretty wooded gorge sceneries, lovely alpine landscapes, and beautiful meadows full of flowers. A zigzag path leads through a splendid forest passage, and a little later you reach Flims. The Flims landslide not only shaped this sunny plateau, but also the wild Rhine gorge and the crystal-clear bathing lakes of Cauma, Cresta and Laax.",

En route: spectacular views of the Leventina Valley with extended motorway entry and exit points. This stage begins on Switzerland\u2019s most important Alpine pass at over 2100 m. The scenery at the top is unforgettable. No wonder it is jam-packed with tourists during the summer months. Some take selfies at the sparkling mountain lakes, while others step back in time and visit the national St. Gotthard Museum or the Sasso San Gottardo defence installation. Few people know that the Gotthard Pass is also an important water divide with the sources of Rhine, Rhone, Reuss and Ticino all within this area.  Just a couple of minutes on the historic mule trail and the clamour is behind you. Heading south toward Airolo you pass the Chapel of the Dead and then the partly paved mule trail meanders down and across meadows scattered with rocks. Soon you will spot the world-famous Tremola road. The landmarked mountain pass is one of the highlights of today\u2019s hike. It descends 340 altitude meters through 24 turns. Post coaches used to clatter down the road in the olden days. Now it is popular with mountain bikers and motorcycle riders. The hikers are very close to this impressive structure, which is perfectly embedded in the terrain. They cross this awe-inspiring road with retaining walls of as much as 8 m multiple times and in some places they even walk on it. Mother Nature is also part of the scenery: while the roar of an engine might occasionally disturb the peace, you will also hear marmots whistling nearby and if you pay attention, you\u2019ll even see a few away from the road. The upper part of the route is all about the old road and the muleteers, but the second section represents a different time. You see the Gotthard highway down in the valley and the new road across the pass. Crossing under a viaduct brings the former Motto Bartola defence structure into view, now a Swiss Army base. A narrow mountain trail leads past it and continues through meadows and short forest areas. The last section of the path down to Airolo offers a fantastic view of the Leventina Valley and the surrounding mountains. The trail passes through the lovely old town centre with its winding lanes and heads for the train station below. Airolo is a crossroads of traffic routes from different eras: the old 13th century mule track, the old railway tunnel which opened in 1882 and the Gotthard road tunnel, built approximately 100 years later. A monument by artist Vincenzo Vela near the train station honours the workmen who died during the construction of the railway tunnel.",

Mother Nature is also part of the scenery: while the roar of an engine might occasionally disturb the peace, you will also hear marmots whistling nearby and if you pay attention, you\u2019ll even see a few away from the road. The upper part of the route is all about the old road and the muleteers, but the second section represents a different time. You see the Gotthard highway down in the valley and the new road across the pass. Crossing under a viaduct brings the former Motto Bartola defence structure into view, now a Swiss Army base. A narrow mountain trail leads past it and continues through meadows and short forest areas. The last section of the path down to Airolo offers a fantastic view of the Leventina Valley and the surrounding mountains. The trail passes through the lovely old town centre with its winding lanes and heads for the train station below. Airolo is a crossroads of traffic routes from different eras: the old 13th century mule track, the old railway tunnel which opened in 1882 and the Gotthard road tunnel, built approximately 100 years later. A monument by artist Vincenzo Vela near the train station honours the workmen who died during the construction of the railway tunnel."

From La Plaine, you pass through the villages of Avully, Avusy, S\u00e9zegnin, Soral, Laconnex, Lully and Bardonnex to reach La Croix-de-Rozon. The hike begins just outside the hamlet of Sauverny (F) on the French-Swiss border. The first part follows the meandering course of the Versoix river, which shortly before in France was called Divonne. In this section, the river crosses the Combes Chapuis nature reserve, which is not only a treat for the eyes in itself, but also provides a habitat for a diverse flora and fauna. After leaving the course of the river for a while to explore the forest paths of the Bois de Versoix, you rejoin the lovely stream not far from the Pont de Bossy. On the other bank, there is a picnic area with tables and barbecues. Here and in La B\u00e2tie, the next hamlet along the way, there are fortifications from the Second World War.

As you hike towards the valley, you'll enjoy views of the Bernese Alps and their glaciers as well as the Central Swiss peaks including Mount Titlis, the Stanserhorn, and Mounts Mythen, Rigi and Pilatus. Equally splendid: emerald-green Lake Lungern, a paradise for fishing enthusiasts.  The path is lined with an abundance of flora and fauna thanks to traditional and ecological cultivation by the mountain farmers. The hike passes through a plant conservation zone. Over 100 species of diurnal butterflies flit about on the dry grassland, including many rare and protected species. 17 information panels along the path describe the most striking types, with information about the butterflies, their development and distribution, and also about the plant world and the landscape structures. The largest numbers of butterflies can be observed between June and August.  Other rare insects and plants also feel very much at home on these sunlit slopes. Over 20 varieties of orchids and lilies can be found here between the end of May and mid-October. If you set out in the early morning hours, you'll have the best chances of spotting ibex, chamois, stags, roe deer or even eagles.

Like yesterday, the day begins with a descent. The path slides westwards from the Col du Dem\u00e8cre (2361 m). On a slope covered with alpine plants, it forms a wide arc around the Creux de Z\u00e9man, before reaching a watering hole. The path becomes hilly and steep towards Rionda, making it unsuitable for those prone to vertigo. The lower path via Chalet Neuf, L'Au d'Arbignon to Rionda is therefore a sensible alternative in bad weather or if you are prone to vertigo. This involves following the path that continues downhill to the left after the watering hole. For those not prone to vertigo, the direct route to Rionada offers an unforgettable panorama: as you emerge from the forest, the view opens out onto Mont Dolent, the border mountain between Switzerland, France and Italy, as well as the Trient massif, Mont Blanc and the Dents du Midi. Not forgetting the Rhone Valley as far as Lake Geneva. A wide footpath below the Pointe des Martinets leads from Rionda to the La Tourche hut (2198 m) in 20 minutes. From here, a steep grassy path climbs to the Vire aux B\u0153ufs, a pass overlooking the Javerne valley. This path is quite slippery in wet weather. A further 200 metres of ascent over slate scree takes you to the Col des Perris Blancs at 2544 metres. From the pass, continue to climb to your right towards the Pointe des Martinets and continue along a somewhat airy path, partially secured by chains, to the Col des Martinets. The long descent from the col takes you to the bottom of the Nant valley and continues along the L'Avancon de Nant torrent to Pont de Nant. At the end of this stage, the table is laid and you find a well-deserved soft bed. For those who suffer from vertigo, it is advisable to reach Pont de Nant via the path through the Javerne mountain pasture. \u00a0",

Like yesterday, the day begins with a descent. The path slides westwards from the Col du Dem\u00e8cre (2361 m). On a slope covered with alpine plants, it forms a wide arc around the Creux de Z\u00e9man, before reaching a watering hole. The path becomes hilly and steep towards Rionda, making it unsuitable for those prone to vertigo. The lower path via Chalet Neuf, L'Au d'Arbignon to Rionda is therefore a sensible alternative in bad weather or if you are prone to vertigo. This involves following the path that continues downhill to the left after the watering hole. For those not prone to vertigo, the direct route to Rionada offers an unforgettable panorama: as you emerge from the forest, the view opens out onto Mont Dolent, the border mountain between Switzerland, France and Italy, as well as the Trient massif, Mont Blanc and the Dents du Midi. Not forgetting the Rhone Valley as far as Lake Geneva. A wide footpath below the Pointe des Martinets leads from Rionda to the La Tourche hut (2198 m) in 20 minutes. From here, a steep grassy path climbs to the Vire aux B\u0153ufs, a pass overlooking the Javerne valley. This path is quite slippery in wet weather. A further 200 metres of ascent over slate scree takes you to the Col des Perris Blancs at 2544 metres. From the pass, continue to climb to your right towards the Pointe des Martinets and continue along a somewhat airy path, partially secured by chains, to the Col des Martinets. The long descent from the col takes you to the bottom of the Nant valley and continues along the L'Avancon de Nant torrent to Pont de Nant. At the end of this stage, the table is laid and you find a well-deserved soft bed. For those who suffer from vertigo, it is advisable to reach Pont de Nant via the path through the Javerne mountain pasture. \u00a0"

The highest point is the Wyssbodehorn with a magnificent view down towards the mountain pass and across to the Valais alps. Engiloch is situated halfway between the Simplon pass and Simplon village and is a popular starting point for hikes. At first on relatively even terrain, this tour leads past larches to the Chluismatta alpine hut. Here you can taste local products (by appointment). Then the ascent begins: following the left side of the Ritzibach, you climb up the slope to Wysse Bode (2113 m). From here you enjoy a beautiful view of the waterfall, which you are now walking towards.  The trail then leads through a steep slope to a rock ledge. This part is secured with a rope. Steps carved into the stone also help with the ascent. The rocky terrain is overcome on the left side of the waterfall via a ramp. Behind it, somewhat hidden in a scree hollow: the crystal-clear Sirwoltu lake, which is dammed by a mighty moraine. Situated between Galehorn and B\u00f6shorn, it invites you to take a break. Afterwards, concentration and stamina are once again required: the trail climbs uphill over a steep scree slope to the highest point of the tour. The strenuous ascent to the Wyssbodehorn (2,623 m), which should only be tackled when visibility is good, is rewarded: the view over the Simplon pass with the Monte Leone massif is unique. The Valais alps greet you to the north, the Ossola mountains to the south. From now on, it's all downhill: following the ridge, you first cross the hilltop at Galu. You will see the Rossbode glacier and behind it, the north side of the Fletschhorn. A steep zigzag path descends to the alpine huts on the Rossbodustafel. The last, pleasant section leads over a wooded ridge down to Egga, the destination of the hiking tour. From here it is not far to Simplon village on the south side of the pass. The typical stone slab roofs and the piazza remind of nearby Italy, the village centre is surrounded by historic buildings.",

An almost constant, yet comfortable climb to scale the Chasseral, a mountain which you will already have seen in the distance. Sensational panoramic views with the lakes on the Swiss Plateau are a delight for the eyes. The trail now quickly leads away from the motorways in Frinvillier. It is a steep, relentless climb uphill to around 1,100 m at Les Coperies.

Up on the pass and already on Italian soil is the generously dimensioned Sesvenna-Berghaus. The climb begins in the small village of Sur En. North of the hiking trail, more than 180 wood and stone figures are displayed deep in the forest. They were created by international and regional artists in connection with the annual sculptors\u2019 symposium in Sur En.  The first part of the route follows the \u201cPuntins Ots Uina\u201d loop trail where information about historic events is provided. It follows old mule tracks and also features attractive via ferrata elements. Parts of the Swiss movie \u201cLittle Mountain Boy\u201d (known as \u201cSchellen-Ursli\u201d in Switzerland) were filmed here, such as the famous crash of the loaded wagon and part of the cattle\u2019s return to the valley. With some imagination you might even hear the tree trunks thundering down to the valley.  Part of the forest trail runs through the narrow valley between steep cliffs, climbs high above the gorge and passes through several tunnels. Every now and then you have gorgeous views of the surrounding peaks of the Sesvenna group. Through the rocks on the valley floor and past coniferous trees the path continues steadily uphill. At an altitude of almost 1,500 m the valley opens up for the first time and Alp Uina Dadora comes into view. After another uphill section between coniferous trees and scree slopes you reach Alp Uina Dadaint where you may want to take a break at the mountain restaurant. The steep cliffs of the Uina Gorge are visible in the south.  Between Piz Rims and Piz da Gliasen a 600 m long path was blasted into the limestone rock wall to create a passage through the gorge. The path is about a meter wide and part of it runs below the projecting rock face. In some places it is secured with ropes and handrails. You also pass through two short, but unlit tunnels, high above the river. You must be surefooted here and have no fear of heights. As late as the 1970s, coffee and cigarettes were smuggled to the Italian South Tyrol on this trail. You continue on a path leading through broad Alpine pastures where the cattle is peacefully grazing. Numerous creeks are flowing through the high valley. Near the national border, at an altitude of about 2,300 m, you reach the Schlinig moorland with its clear mountain lakes. A bit below the Schlinig Pass is the cosy and welcoming Sesvenna Hut of the Alpine Club of South Tyrol. Two small mountain lakes and extensive meadows are located right next to the hut.",

Sainte-Croix in the Vaud Jura is easy to reach by narrow-gauge railway. In the 19th century, this was the global centre of music box production. Modern-day visitors can admire the historic collection at the Centre International de M\u00e9canique d\u2019Art (CIMA) on guided tours. Until Vuiteboeuf, the stage follows the historic salt road (Via Salina), which reaches its high point some way beyond Le Ch\u00e2teau. But first comes the hard work: the first section of about two kilometres runs along a main road, making the view of Lake Neuch\u00e2tel even more beautiful. After about an hour, hikers reach one of the most significant preserved medieval road systems in Switzerland. The longest cart track of its time can still be found in the dense beech forest on the steep descent. Thanks to the channels carved into the Jura limestone, the muleteers were able to drive their salt-laden ox carts over the steep terrain until the 19th century. In 2014, the historic salt road was turned into an educational trail. Information boards tell the story of this important traffic artery between France and Switzerland dating back to the 13th century. After the steep descent on a narrow forest path, the route runs on mostly flat terrain through the sweeping agricultural land of the Jura plain. From the village of Vuiteboeuf with 500 inhabitants where waggoners once changed their horses, it skirts the forest at the foot of the \u201cRapilles de Baulmes\u201d cliff. The sound of chirping birds now replaces the engine noise heard on the historic section near the road. After just under an hour, the trail reaches the little village of Baulmes. It leaves the Jura chain behind, crossing huge arable fields and passing by cattle herds and farms. After almost an hour-and-a-half, it reaches Switzerland\u2019s oldest controlled wine-growing area: the C\u00f4tes de l\u2019Orbe.

An even older church, probably from the 10th century, can be found in Montcherand. The walls inside this Cluniac place of worship are adorned by the oldest figurative frescos in Switzerland. In the final part of the stage, hikers leave the wide trail at the hydroelectric power station in Montcherand and enter a dense forest traversed by narrow paths. Crossing the Orbe Gorge (Gorges de l\u2019Orbe) over a small suspension bridge is an impressive experience.

        "description": "The Alpine Passes Trail strings together many of the most beautiful passes in the Graubunden and Valais Alps in 43 stages. One highlight follows another from the Greina Plateau to the passes and lake landscape at the foot of the Dents du Midi. Hiking over passes is a special discipline with its own devotees. It\u2019s not mountaineers seeking spectacular summit views or the satisfaction of conquering the mountain but hikers driven by curiosity who wend their way up the \u00abFurggeln\u00bb or \u00abBocchette\u00bb passes. Because every pass holds the secret of the unknown on the other side. What\u2019s on the map is not enough; the aim is to discover a new world with each valley \u2013 and to leave the old one behind. The Alpine Passes Trail strings together many of the most beautiful and impressive passes in the Graubunden and Valais Alps on one continuous route. The result is a challenging but fascinating Alpine hiking tour with 43 stages. One highlight follows another, from the Greina Plateau to the passes and lake landscape at the foot of the Dents du Midi. Clearly it\u2019s not likely that all stages will be covered at one time \u2013 but it can be hiked in sections. One major advantage of hiking the passes is the opportunity to leave or join the route in any valley between two passes. And once you\u2019ve trodden the entire route \u2013 you can claim that you\u2019ve looked deep into the soul of the Graubunden and Valais mountain world."

One has to climb exactly 725 metres to find yourself standing in the middle of an arena of superlatives. This natural amphitheatre has a diameter of one kilometre and is the result of constant erosion by water and ice. It is a paradise for mountain goats, marmots, deer, birds of prey and nature lovers.

The second major attraction of the valley, which stretches from Lake Neuch\u00e2tel crosswise through the Jura to the French border, is its asphalt mines. Between 1711 and 1986 a tunnel system of 100 kilometres was established here. Streets in Paris, London and New York were paved with asphalt from Travers. Today one kilometre of disused mines is open to visitors, who are served the speciality of ham cooked in asphalt.

It is characterised by narrow streets and houses that stand close together and are partly connected by archways. The most important building in Aigle is the castle, which you pass shortly after the start of the stage at the train station. It was built in the 12th century to protect Aigle, and it enabled access to the Rhone Valley and Pays d'Enhaut to be controlled. After a short stretch of forest, you reach the next vineyards around Ollon in about one and a half hours. The hike is uphill for a while, then proceeds downwards again to Antagnes. There is an incredible view across the Rhone Valley and the surrounding mountains. At the Gryonne river, you are almost halfway through the hike and you have covered most of the altitude difference. You follow the river until just before it flows into the Rhone, which you cross a little later to arrive in Massongex. The village was the capital of Celtic Valais long ago. Now comes the final hour of the hike to the end of this stage in St. Maurice. Pilgrims walking all the way from Canterbury to Rome are now right in the middle of the route. Shortly before St. Maurice you pass the fairy grotto. The water has worn away the rock here for thousands of years, creating a grotto with a small underground lake and waterfall.",

Fascinating views down to the trains of the L\u00f6tschberg Railway, which roll through the Kandertal like a model railway. Kiental is one of the large side valleys of the Kandertal Valley in the Bernese Oberland and located in the middle of an intact natural environment. The village of the same name is also the starting point of the chairlift to Ramslauenen. From Reichenbach in the Kandertal at the beginning of the Kiental valley, Europe\u2019s steepest postbus route leads via Kiental village to Griesalp. Pochtenschlucht gorge, for example, has a gradient of up to 28%. During the ride, the environment changes from a lovely valley to a rugged high mountain landscape. The hiking trail starts in Kiental, at the base station of the chairlift. The first 500 altitude metres of the tour are strenuous and take roughly 1 \u00bd hours, but once you have reached Ramslauenen, the worst is over.

Fascinating views down to the trains of the L\u00f6tschberg Railway, which roll through the Kandertal like a model railway. Kiental is one of the large side valleys of the Kandertal Valley in the Bernese Oberland and located in the middle of an intact natural environment. The village of the same name is also the starting point of the chairlift to Ramslauenen. From Reichenbach in the Kandertal at the beginning of the Kiental valley, Europe\u2019s steepest postbus route leads via Kiental village to Griesalp. Pochtenschlucht gorge, for example, has a gradient of up to 28%. During the ride, the environment changes from a lovely valley to a rugged high mountain landscape. The hiking trail starts in Kiental, at the base station of the chairlift. The first 500 altitude metres of the tour are strenuous and take roughly 1 \u00bd hours, but once you have reached Ramslauenen, the worst is over.

The traces of the landslide stem from the fateful day on September 2, 1806, when a gigantic mass of rock broke from the slopes of the western ridge of the Rossberg and slid on a layer of clay and marl into the valley. Due to persistent heavy rainfalls this slide buried 102 homes of the R\u00f6then and Goldau hamlets under about 400 million m3 of debris. It even reached the western shore of Lake Lauerz where it caused a flood wave. Overall, 457 people and over 320 animals lost their lives in the disastrous event. The hiking trail through Goldau\u2019s landslide area starts at the Arth-Goldau train station. Near the last buildings of the village it enters the H\u00e4rzigwald forest and immediately climbs relatively steeply uphill. This first section \u2013 from the train station up to Spitzib\u00fcel \u2013 follows the route of the Schwyzer H\u00f6henweg (high-altitude trail). Then it crosses over to Oberspitzib\u00fcel. On the mound of scree in the landslide area, through which the trail loops back to Goldau, the hikers come across numerous silent witnesses of long ago: gigantic prehistoric boulders are part of the landscape. Today the Goldau landslide area is a cantonal plant reserve. Plants that would normally not have a chance of developing in the wooded landscape were able to thrive in this extensive area. Botany buffs come here primarily to find rare orchid plants, such as Lady\u2019s Slippers, Twayblades or Helleborines. Some of these grow right beside the trail. The best opportunity to see them in full bloom is in early summer.",

        "description": "A varied tour through the landslide area in Goldau, featuring Lake Lauerz, the S\u00e4gel nature reserve, the village of Goldau situated on the scree, as well as the Goldau Animal Park and the actual landslide zone, which is also famous for its wealth of rare orchids. The traces of the landslide stem from the fateful day on September 2, 1806, when a gigantic mass of rock broke from the slopes of the western ridge of the Rossberg and slid on a layer of clay and marl into the valley. Due to persistent heavy rainfalls this slide buried 102 homes of the R\u00f6then and Goldau hamlets under about 400 million m3 of debris. It even reached the western shore of Lake Lauerz where it caused a flood wave. Overall, 457 people and over 320 animals lost their lives in the disastrous event. The hiking trail through Goldau\u2019s landslide area starts at the Arth-Goldau train station. Near the last buildings of the village it enters the H\u00e4rzigwald forest and immediately climbs relatively steeply uphill. This first section \u2013 from the train station up to Spitzib\u00fcel \u2013 follows the route of the Schwyzer H\u00f6henweg (high-altitude trail). Then it crosses over to Oberspitzib\u00fcel. On the mound of scree in the landslide area, through which the trail loops back to Goldau, the hikers come across numerous silent witnesses of long ago: gigantic prehistoric boulders are part of the landscape. Today the Goldau landslide area is a cantonal plant reserve. Plants that would normally not have a chance of developing in the wooded landscape were able to thrive in this extensive area. Botany buffs come here primarily to find rare orchid plants, such as Lady\u2019s Slippers, Twayblades or Helleborines. Some of these grow right beside the trail. The best opportunity to see them in full bloom is in early summer."

On the way: a typical Engadine village, an old convalescent hotel, hanging bridges and mountain trails, passing lakes, waterfalls and glacier residue. Von Scuol Cluozza an always gently uphill trail leads via a beautiful terrace through dry grasslands with a wealth of plant species, to Sent. The typical Engadine village is well-known for its gables and richly adorned houses. Those with a flair for contemporary art should visit the Parkin of artist Not Vital. The route continues through sloping meadows with beautiful views of the Lower Engadine. Along the flanks of the wild, forested Val Sinestra you reach the historically interesting Hof Zuort guest house, where there is also a chapel with a 14-bell glockenspiel, built in 1920-1924 by well-known Dutch conductor Mengelberg. The trail then climbs via scenic Alp Griosch to the Fimberpass at 2608 m, with wonderful views of the surrounding mountain world. You then climb from the Heidelberger Hut through pastures on a path of differing gradients, through easily negotiable scree along the slopes of the Piz Davo Sass\u00e8 to a small lake. From here, the route continues through a wide, shallow hollow to the highest point of the hike, Fuorcla Val Gronda at 2752 m altitude, where you cross the border into Austria. After traversing the scree slope below the Versilspitz, you reach the Zeblasjoch and Swiss soil again, duty-free from here on. The trail then leads through a varied landscape, past glacier residue, waterfalls and meadows to your destination, the village of Samnaun.",

Eiger, M\u00f6nch and Jungfrau \u2013 see the triple diadem close at hand \u2013 but take the easy way up! For over 120 years, the little train has conquered gradients of up to 25% to reach the viewing terrace.  The circular tour to the ridge is best started between the mountain station and the hotel. In good conditions, walkers ascend across the western side of the Gumihorn and then continue up to the Tuba, with views of Lake Thun, the Niesen, the Stockhorn and the Jura behind them.

Iron ore deposits and large supplies of firewood made Vallorbe an industrial site from very early on. The location on the French border also awarded the town in the Vaud Jura strategic importance and made it a traffic hub. The hike starts at the train station which is surprisingly large for a village with less than 4000 inhabitants.

The path leads towards the Swiss bridge above Vallorbe before penetrating into the Jurassic forest, where sports enthusiasts can do the parcours VITA.

A route through a stunning landscape with spectacular close-up views of the Bietschhorn and Mischabel group. Descent to Lauchernalp through glacier-eroded terrain laced with lakes. Selden is situated in the Gasteretal. It is the starting point of the physically demanding hike across the L\u00f6tschen Pass. First, you cross the Kander on a suspension bridge. The source of the river at Kanderfirn is located further up the mountain. The glacier, exposed to the west, starts near Tschingelhorn and Petersgrat. The latter is almost completely covered by ice.  At first, the path enters the forest and zigzags steeply uphill to Gfelalp, but mostly in the shade. Along the way you will pass three waterfalls on the Leitibach.  Leaving the tree line behind, you will reach a small alluvial plain of the Leitibach below Sch\u00f6nb\u00fchl. A fantastic view of the mountain chain opens up here, including Dolden-, Fr\u00fcnden-, Oeschinen- and Bl\u00fcmlisalphorn, all above 3300 m, and all the way to the Kanderfirn glacier. Continue uphill, across the pasture, and you soon get to Balme at the end of the L\u00f6tsche glacier. The hiking time up to this point takes at least 2.5 hours. You then traverse the end of the glacier across a scree slope and approach the glacier. The last steep section follows a short while later: a narrow path up the cliff, secured in part by steel cables. After about 15 minutes, you reach an altitude of 2689 m and there you are, on top of the L\u00f6tschen Pass.  The view of the prominent Bietschorn is spectacular. The descent takes you through an area of glacial polishing, interspersed with small lakes. In the distance, you will recognize the mountain chain with the Dom and the peaks of Weisshorn, Zinalrothorn and Matterhorn. It takes about 1.5 hours to get down to Lauchernalp, which is today\u2019s destination. The resort is situated on a sunny plateau above Wiler in the L\u00f6tschental and can be reached by gondola.",

At first, the path enters the forest and zigzags steeply uphill to Gfelalp, but mostly in the shade. Along the way you will pass three waterfalls on the Leitibach.  Leaving the tree line behind, you will reach a small alluvial plain of the Leitibach below Sch\u00f6nb\u00fchl. A fantastic view of the mountain chain opens up here, including Dolden-, Fr\u00fcnden-, Oeschinen- and Bl\u00fcmlisalphorn, all above 3300 m, and all the way to the Kanderfirn glacier. Continue uphill, across the pasture, and you soon get to Balme at the end of the L\u00f6tsche glacier. The hiking time up to this point takes at least 2.5 hours. You then traverse the end of the glacier across a scree slope and approach the glacier. The last steep section follows a short while later: a narrow path up the cliff, secured in part by steel cables. After about 15 minutes, you reach an altitude of 2689 m and there you are, on top of the L\u00f6tschen Pass.  The view of the prominent Bietschorn is spectacular. The descent takes you through an area of glacial polishing, interspersed with small lakes. In the distance, you will recognize the mountain chain with the Dom and the peaks of Weisshorn, Zinalrothorn and Matterhorn. It takes about 1.5 hours to get down to Lauchernalp, which is today\u2019s destination. The resort is situated on a sunny plateau above Wiler in the L\u00f6tschental and can be reached by gondola."

The trees and rocks here could tell many a tale of smuggling. Sainte-Croix is famed worldwide for its music boxes and music automatons. From the train station, the path leads out of the village and climbs up to the Aiguilles de Baulmes ridge. Once at the top, a panoramic section continues all the way to the summit. The view extends over the alpine chain with the Mont Blanc, the lakes of Neuch\u00e2tel and Geneva, the D\u00f4le region and the Chasseral. Rugged rock belts, up to 80 metres high and facing south, characterise the mountain ridge.  At Col de l\u2019Aiguillon, you are just a few hundred meters away from the French border. Tank traps remind you that the frontier is close, and you will come across military bunkers throughout this stage. After leaving the forest behind you, it is worth looking back at the rock wall of Aiguilles de Baulmes. The climb to Le Suchet starts after Grange Neuve. You really should not miss the five-minute detour to the summit, to take another look back at the peaks along the Jura Crest Trail.  As you descend to Le Suchet chalet, you can enjoy the sweeping views of Lake Neuch\u00e2tel, the plain and even the Alps in the distance. The downhill walk takes about two hours, through enchanting Jura meadows until you reach Ballaigues.

A little way outside of Ballaigues, you can discover a historic cart track (Roman road).

In the mid-19th century, sought-after salt was transported via this route from the French saltworks to Bern and western Switzerland.

If you wish to travel to the Gotthard Pass the way they did in the times of the legendary Gotthard stagecoach in the mid-19th century, book a trip with the old, five-horse post coach. Or go even further back in time and choose the footpath. The muleteers transported their goods on this route as far back as the 13th century. At that time, the Gotthard Pass became one of the most important Alpine crossings. Who knew that traffic congestion on the Gotthard was problematic even then? Nowadays cars are held up in traffic jams before they get to the tunnel, but for hikers the way is clear. A comfortable flat trail leads through the romantic Urseren Valley between Andermatt and Hospental.

The hike starts at the end of the public road in the idyllic Vallon de Van with a steep ascent through the valley to the Salanfe dam.

The descent leads to Elm, facing a wonderful Glarner panorama. The stage starts at the end of the virtually uninhabited Calfeisen valley with a splendid view over the valley floor and the Gigerwald lake. The first section of the route leads along the steep slope back to the Heub\u00fctzli pass. The trail climbs far above the tree line over alpine meadows, scree gullies, streams and past rock faces. With a bit of luck, you can observe a family of marmots. Once on the pass, you look down on the Heub\u00fctzli lake, situated in a scree hollow. A narrow, pointed, rocky ridge stretches out to the left and right. The trail now continues partly on the mountain ridge around the Fahnenstock and then down into the Muota valley. Here it is quite possible to be observed by ibexes (or vice versa). Their majestic silhouettes stand out impressively against the Muota valley ridge. Numerous rocks have tumbled onto the meadows from the steep slopes on both sides. The special formations of terrain and rocks are a witness to the forces of nature that have been at work here over millions of years. Upon arrival at the Foobach rushing through deeply cut rock hollows, the descent ends and the route heads uphill once more. Passing picturesque rock faces in the green countryside, the trail now heads towards the Foo pass. Above the Heidelbach stream, you will notice a great variety of flora. Once on top of the Foo pass, the view opens up over the massive mountain ranges of the Sernftal valley. Here you reach the highest point of the stage at 2,223 metres and begin a long descent down to Elm with its 1,041 metres above sea level. Initially, the trail is steep and zigzags across stony slopes to Raminer Matt. Later it continues down into the valley on firmer paths through the forest. Here, one\u2019s attention is drawn time and again to the impressive waterfalls tumbling from the cliffs on the opposite side of the slope. During the descent, the main Glarus overthrust between Ringelspitz and Piz Sardona becomes clearly visible. The distinct horizontal line in the mountain separates two layers of rock. The supporting lower layer is more than 200 million years younger than the darker layer above. Once at the bottom of the valley, the trail continues across the Sernf river to Elm. From here it is well worth taking a look back at the mountain scenery and the Martinsloch (Martin's hole). Twice a year, the sun shines through this drop-shaped opening to illuminate the church tower of Elm. The hole is said to have been cut into the rock in the battle between the heroic Martin and the evil giant. In the slate museum in Elm, you can learn more about slate mining which marked this valley, and the production site of Elmer Citro offers a first-hand experience of the springs. You can descend into the spring area and learn how mineral water is generated from rain and snow deep in the Glarus mountains over the course of eight years.",

The magic of nature combined with the work of mankind has bestowed peace and harmony to this valley, one of Ticino\u2019s most beautiful.

Very interesting are the so-called  , buildings under the rock that have made it possible to adapt nature to the needs of humans, creating shelters, housing and stables. Also very surprising is the ingenuity behind the transformation of the upper part of massive boulders into small gardens, protected from the voracious goats that stroll about the valley.

Along the course you will encounter a number of   and go through woods of chestnut trees - once considered to be \"the tree of life\" because of its vital role for the survival of the population. In Foroglio, the best known village of the valley because of the spectacular waterfall, you can spot a few houses with a wide arcade and a number of   gathered around a small church. Inside the church, you can admire the interesting altar from the 16th century. Also in town, the excellent Grotto Froda (a tavern) that offers traditional Ticino dishes and is run by Martino Giovanettina, a local intellectual. Another point of interest is the centre of Sonlerto, where to avoid taking land from the pastures the houses were built between the boulders of a prehistoric landslide. The graceful oratory of Gannariente, with precious frescoes from the 16th century, has been a destination from time immemorial of a historical procession that occurs the first Sunday of May.

The magic of nature combined with the work of mankind has bestowed peace and harmony to this valley, one of Ticino\u2019s most beautiful. Consisting of extremely high cliffs and remains of colossal landslides it is also one of the steepest and rockiest valleys of the entire Alpine region. An enchanting walk that goes through twelve villages, including Foroglio with its spectacular  \n                                 The route is fascinating not only from an environmental point of view but also for the testimonials of human intervention found along the way, that prove how through an adequate interpretation of the territory it is possible to turn even the most hostile of natural elements into an ally. Very interesting are the so-called  , buildings under the rock that have made it possible to adapt nature to the needs of humans, creating shelters, housing and stables. Also very surprising is the ingenuity behind the transformation of the upper part of massive boulders into small gardens, protected from the voracious goats that stroll about the valley. The itinerary that runs through the entire Bavona Valley can start either in Bignasco or in Cavergno. Along the course you will encounter a number of   and go through woods of chestnut trees - once considered to be \"the tree of life\" because of its vital role for the survival of the population. In Foroglio, the best known village of the valley because of the spectacular waterfall, you can spot a few houses with a wide arcade and a number of   gathered around a small church. Inside the church, you can admire the interesting altar from the 16th century. Also in town, the excellent Grotto Froda (a tavern) that offers traditional Ticino dishes and is run by Martino Giovanettina, a local intellectual. Another point of interest is the centre of Sonlerto, where to avoid taking land from the pastures the houses were built between the boulders of a prehistoric landslide. The graceful oratory of Gannariente, with precious frescoes from the 16th century, has been a destination from time immemorial of a historical procession that occurs the first Sunday of May. The excursion ends in San Carlo, the last village of the Bavona Valley and  departure point of the cableway that goes up to   (below the Basodino glacier). From there you may choose to return by bus to Bignasco or Cavergno.\n                                "

This is the vision that inspired Captain Neil Boyd McEacharn, an academic and a member of the Royal Company of Archers, to create this magnificent 20-hectare park in 1931, a perfect example of an English Garden in Italy. His goal was to build an environment capable of housing the richest collection of precious exotic plants, in compliance with the biological features of each species, while simultaneously satisfying both aesthetic and botanical requirements. Following its purchase, the property was readapted, with terracing and excavation works, in order to accommodate the park of his dreams. The cultivations that required shade and shelter from the wind were placed in a protected, artificial valley, while the ones that needed sunlight were planted in the park\u2019s terraced gardens. A special pumping system, designed to drain water directly from the lake thanks to a pipeline measuring 8km in length, was built in order to guarantee an adequate water supply.  The plant life of Villa Taranto is extremely rich: it boasts over one thousand foreign plants and nearly 20 thousand varieties and species of significant botanical importance. Among others, visitors can admire magnolias, eucalypti, rare tropical plants, lotus flowers, chestnut trees, birches, tulips, dahlias, Indian paintbrushes, azaleas, narcissi, rhododendrons, hydrangeas as well as several exceptional specimens of beech trees. While strolling along the paths of the park you will come across terraces, turfs, waterfalls and ponds. It was 1931 when Captain Neil Boyd McEacharn read an advertisement in the London \"Times\" stating that the Marquise of Sant\u2019Elia intended to sell her estate \u201cLa Crocetta\u201d in Pallanza, on Lake Maggiore. From the description, the place seemed ideal to fulfill the Captain\u2019s life-long dream, namely the creation of one of the world\u2019s most beautiful botanical parks. He had already tackled a similar challenge with the renovation of the vast park of Galloway House, his family\u2019s castle in Scotland. Negotiations with the Marquise of Sant\u2019Elia were concluded shortly thereafter and reconstruction began in 1931. Neil Boyd McEacharn came from a wealthy Scottish family. Not only was his father an Anglo-Australian shipping magnate, but his wife\u2019s family also owned rich iron and coal mines in Australia, as well as a vast sheep farming estate, boasting over one million sheep, thereby guaranteeing the import of wool into England. Neil visited Italy for the first time at the tender age of eight, docking in Livorno during a cruise on his father\u2019s yacht. According to him, it was a question of love at first sight. Even while studying at Eton and Oxford, he used to spend his holidays \u2013 as was customary for members of the elite \u2013 on the Mediterranean, painting Italian landscapes. He went on his first trip around the world aged just sixteen, repeating the experience five more times throughout his life, trawling the four corners of the earth in search of rare and unknown plant species to show and spread across Europe \u2013 and, most importantly, to display at his marvelous gardens surrounding Villa Taranto, where he lived until the year of his death in1964, aged 80.

A main valley and a suspended lateral one, connected to each other by the waterfall's watercourse\". Next to the waterfall there is a gracious village with houses gathered around its little 15th century church where you can enjoy a Germanic school triptych of 1553 and a Roman painting from the end of the 16th century illustrating the \"Presentation of the Virgin at the Temple\". In the village, next to the traditional stone houses, you can also see some  : \"buildings that functioned as barns - explains Bruno Donati - and that were constituted by a stone base with mushroom-shaped supporting structures on which lay an upper part made of wood. These are old buildings dating back to the days of the cultivation of rye, that was set to dry on the landing and preserved in the barn cell\". Among the most renowned citizens of the valley we find the Ticino writer Plinio Martini, author of   (Bottom of the bag) that tells the story of peasant life in the past. The Osteria Froda (tavern) located in Foroglio offers a splendid view on the waterfall. Run by an intellectual, Martino Giovanettina (author of the cited pocketbook), this is a place where, as described by Marco M\u00fcller ex Director of the Locarno and Venetian Film Festivals, \"one can truly breathe another life, gaze at the waterfall and eat a   or   with   based on some guy's recipe which is long lost in the city\". The itinerary (not very difficult) unfolds along cliffs, stony grounds, boulders and miniscule stone huts surrounded by meagre lawns. A landscape marked by nature:  , rivers, floods and landslides have deeply moulded it. During the nice season the peasants of Bignasco and Cavergno  moved to the Bavona Valley exploiting every single tuft of grass and used to go up the Caln\u00e8gia Valley that opens up above Foroglio. The proofs of their activities are numerous and touching: every cleft, every boulder was used as shelter for people, livestock,  , hay and firewood. Humans' work and manmade constructions have admirably harmonized with the mineral and vegetal world, partially by adapting and partially by domesticating. Leaving Foroglio, in the presence of the beautiful waterfall, you can go up thanks to a steep trail. Once you've reached the plain above the waterfall, you will encounter a first mid-altitude pasture, Puntid, where it is worth to make a detour of approximately 20 minutes (go and back) to an impressive building under the rock, the  , an ancient shelter for herdsmen and goats. Once you return to Puntid, you will cross a pretty little bridge and continue along the level bottom of the valley (circa 3 km) between extremely steep stone walls. Along the course there's another signposted detour that leads to Gerra, another beautiful mid-altitude pasture. Back on the main trail you will shortly reach Caln\u00e8gia, the last settlement before a very steep ascent to the mountain pastures, reserved for expert and equipped hikers. You will then return to Foroglio following the same course. Caution: bathing in the pools next to the waterfall can be dangerous.

Next to the waterfall there is a gracious village with houses gathered around its little 15th century church where you can enjoy a Germanic school triptych of 1553 and a Roman painting from the end of the 16th century illustrating the \"Presentation of the Virgin at the Temple\". In the village, next to the traditional stone houses, you can also see some  : \"buildings that functioned as barns - explains Bruno Donati - and that were constituted by a stone base with mushroom-shaped supporting structures on which lay an upper part made of wood. These are old buildings dating back to the days of the cultivation of rye, that was set to dry on the landing and preserved in the barn cell\". Among the most renowned citizens of the valley we find the Ticino writer Plinio Martini, author of   (Bottom of the bag) that tells the story of peasant life in the past. The Osteria Froda (tavern) located in Foroglio offers a splendid view on the waterfall. Run by an intellectual, Martino Giovanettina (author of the cited pocketbook), this is a place where, as described by Marco M\u00fcller ex Director of the Locarno and Venetian Film Festivals, \"one can truly breathe another life, gaze at the waterfall and eat a   or   with   based on some guy's recipe which is long lost in the city\". The itinerary (not very difficult) unfolds along cliffs, stony grounds, boulders and miniscule stone huts surrounded by meagre lawns. A landscape marked by nature:  , rivers, floods and landslides have deeply moulded it. During the nice season the peasants of Bignasco and Cavergno  moved to the Bavona Valley exploiting every single tuft of grass and used to go up the Caln\u00e8gia Valley that opens up above Foroglio. The proofs of their activities are numerous and touching: every cleft, every boulder was used as shelter for people, livestock,  , hay and firewood. Humans' work and manmade constructions have admirably harmonized with the mineral and vegetal world, partially by adapting and partially by domesticating. Leaving Foroglio, in the presence of the beautiful waterfall, you can go up thanks to a steep trail. Once you've reached the plain above the waterfall, you will encounter a first mid-altitude pasture, Puntid, where it is worth to make a detour of approximately 20 minutes (go and back) to an impressive building under the rock, the  , an ancient shelter for herdsmen and goats. Once you return to Puntid, you will cross a pretty little bridge and continue along the level bottom of the valley (circa 3 km) between extremely steep stone walls. Along the course there's another signposted detour that leads to Gerra, another beautiful mid-altitude pasture. Back on the main trail you will shortly reach Caln\u00e8gia, the last settlement before a very steep ascent to the mountain pastures, reserved for expert and equipped hikers. You will then return to Foroglio following the same course. Caution: bathing in the pools next to the waterfall can be dangerous.  Note: in the Caln\u00e8gia Valley cell phones are out of range.\n                                "

A literary caf\u00e9 was opened in the vicinity of the museum where you can find some of Hermann Hesse's main works. In the calm of the serene enchantment of this region the author of \u201cSiddharta\u201d certainly found the peace he always sought and that allowed him to bring to life some masterpieces that are today \u2013 half a century after his death \u2013 some of the most widely read and appreciated books in the world. A \"homeland of the soul\": this is what the Golden Hill became for Hesse, to be discovered with the audioguide that may be obtained at the museum and that takes the visitor through a beautiful landscape, accompanied by a voice and on the footsteps of the writer himself. You will see his favourite places, the houses where he lived, the woods where he enjoyed walking and painting, the   (taverns) - like the Cavicc, still open today - where Hesse would spend a few hours in the shade. The walk with the audioguide \"On the footsteps of Hermann Hesse\" starts from the museum, covers eleven points and unravels between Montagnola and Gentilino following the stages of the author's life in Ticino. Leaving the Museum you can enjoy the Casa Camuzzi, Hesse's first house. Cross the centre of Certenago, that appears in his watercolours, before reaching the Sant\u2019Abbondio complex in Gentilino, in which cemetery lays Hesse next to his wife Ninon. Walking through the woods, you will come across   where, as the author enjoyed doing, you may take a rest. Here you can imagine meeting Hermann Hesse with easel and brushes, busy fixing on paper the most beautiful spots of the region, or you can listen to the reconstruction of his talks with the gardener or with the elderly neighbour. Thanks to the beautiful images exhibited in the Museum, you might even think you are seeing him hoeing the ground, taking care of plants or preparing a small fire with the garden's brushwood...

A permanent exhibit set up in the halls of the Torre Camuzzi, adjacent to the Nobel Prize winner's first home, introduces to the forty years that Hesse spent in the South of the Alps from 1919. Collected are objects and works of this author, one of the most widely read in the world: famous are his glasses, the typewriter and the delicate watercolors. An excellent audioguide in Italian and German accompanies the visitor through the pleasant landscapes of the Collina d'oro (Golden Hill), dear to the writer.\n                                 \n                                 Set up in 1997, the Museum is located in the vicinity of the picturesque Casa Camuzzi, where the writer lived from 1919 to 1931 in an apartment with a beautiful view on  . The permanent exhibit gives the visitor the possibility to discover the author's different phases of activity in depth, for example fundamental topics such as India or the creation of the work \"The Glass Bead Game\".

It is characterised by its anthropological approach to the presented topics that lead the visitor along an interactive course.

It's probably thanks to its secluded position from both North and South that the spectacular Ticino village was spared from the devastation and defacement of the 1960s construction industry. Today, when visiting it, it feels like time has simply stopped.\n                                "

The most important works that were competitively selected before the opening of the Museum and that are  part today of the Ascona's Art Collection, include the ones of Russians Marianne Werefkin, Alexej Jawlensky and Robert Genin; works of Germans Arthur Segal, Walter Helbig, Otto Niemeyer-Holstein, Hans Richter, Julius Bissier; some of British Gordon Mallet McCouch as well as Dutch C\u00e9sar Domela and Otto van Rees; others of Swiss Paul Klee, Cuno Amiet, Ernst Frick, Albert Kohler, Ignaz Epper and of Italians Italo Valenti and Marino Marini. In 1995 the Ascona municipality bought the Carl Weidemeyer Fund. In 1927 the German architect and painter established himself in Ascona offering a new type of rational architecture. Among his most important works worth noting is the Teatro San Materno (San Materno Theater) located in front of the second building of the Communal Museum and designed in 1928 for the miming dancer of international renown, Charlotte Bara. The theatre was recently renovated and offers a rich cultural program. The Museo Comunale d\u2019Arte Moderna di Ascona is especially known to host the Collection of the Marianne Werefkin Foundation with the task of enhancing the image and works of this exceptional artist of Russian origin. Among the most important painters of German expressionism, she arrived in Ticino in 1918. This collection \u2013 90 paintings, 170 sketches' books, hundreds of drawings and a huge heritage of autographed documents of literary nature \u2013 is in fact one of the most important ones dedicated to the artist. The Richard and Uli Seewald Foundation also depends on the Museum, which collects works of the artist and Professor at the Munich Academy, Richard Seewald. The Museum regularly organises  exhibition activities giving particular attention to the enhancement of its heritage and to the realization of temporary exhibits dedicated to those artists and movements that have contributed to the history of Ascona. It is also focused on graphic arts, artists and contemporary collectors, proposing itself as an archive and research centre. (M.F.) Since 2014, the Museo Comunale d\u2019Arte Moderna di Ascona disposes of  a second building at the Castello San Materno located at the entrance of the city where it exhibits the Collection of the Alten Foundation with works of renowned Northern European artists of the 19th and 20th centuries. Historically connected to Ascona's cultural context, these authors belong to artistic movements (Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Expressionism) that have marked the passage between two eras and inaugurated the new Modern Art. Firstly, we find the names of Lovis Corinth and Max Liebermann who were in contact with colleagues of the Worpswede colony (opposed to industrialized life), well represented in the Alten Collection with works of Hans am Ende, Fritz Overbeck, Friedrich Meckseper, Walter Bertelsmann, Otto Mondersohn and Paula Mondersohn-Becker. Many of these artists animated the Ascona artistic scene directly or through Monte Verit\u00e0. Indicative enough, the sacred name of the dancer Charlotte Bachrach (stage name Charlotte Bara) who trained in Worpswede and who developed a friendship with artist Carl Weidemeyer, architect of her personal theatre in Ascona (today the Teatro San Materno). Charlotte Bachrach arrived South of the Alps and lived to her death in the Castello San Materno, currently home to the Alten Collection. The collection offers a significant insight into the history of   arts with some works of great value. Those include paintings by German Expressionists from both the \"Br\u00fccke\" of Dresden (Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Erich Heckel, Max Pechstein, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Emil Nolde, Christian Rohlfs) and the \"Blaue Reiter\" of Munich (Alexey Jawlenskij e Gabriele M\u00fcnter).

This is the vision that inspired Captain Neil Boyd McEacharn, an academic and a member of the Royal Company of Archers, to create this magnificent 20-hectare park in 1931, a perfect example of an English Garden in Italy. His goal was to build an environment capable of housing the richest collection of precious exotic plants, in compliance with the biological features of each species, while simultaneously satisfying both aesthetic and botanical requirements. Following its purchase, the property was readapted, with terracing and excavation works, in order to accommodate the park of his dreams. The cultivations that required shade and shelter from the wind were placed in a protected, artificial valley, while the ones that needed sunlight were planted in the park\u2019s terraced gardens. A special pumping system, designed to drain water directly from the lake thanks to a pipeline measuring 8km in length, was built in order to guarantee an adequate water supply.  The plant life of Villa Taranto is extremely rich: it boasts over one thousand foreign plants and nearly 20 thousand varieties and species of significant botanical importance. Among others, visitors can admire magnolias, eucalypti, rare tropical plants, lotus flowers, chestnut trees, birches, tulips, dahlias, Indian paintbrushes, azaleas, narcissi, rhododendrons, hydrangeas as well as several exceptional specimens of beech trees. While strolling along the paths of the park you will come across terraces, turfs, waterfalls and ponds. It was 1931 when Captain Neil Boyd McEacharn read an advertisement in the London \"Times\" stating that the Marquise of Sant\u2019Elia intended to sell her estate \u201cLa Crocetta\u201d in Pallanza, on Lake Maggiore. From the description, the place seemed ideal to fulfill the Captain\u2019s life-long dream, namely the creation of one of the world\u2019s most beautiful botanical parks. He had already tackled a similar challenge with the renovation of the vast park of Galloway House, his family\u2019s castle in Scotland. Negotiations with the Marquise of Sant\u2019Elia were concluded shortly thereafter and reconstruction began in 1931. Neil Boyd McEacharn came from a wealthy Scottish family. Not only was his father an Anglo-Australian shipping magnate, but his wife\u2019s family also owned rich iron and coal mines in Australia, as well as a vast sheep farming estate, boasting over one million sheep, thereby guaranteeing the import of wool into England. Neil visited Italy for the first time at the tender age of eight, docking in Livorno during a cruise on his father\u2019s yacht. According to him, it was a question of love at first sight. Even while studying at Eton and Oxford, he used to spend his holidays \u2013 as was customary for members of the elite \u2013 on the Mediterranean, painting Italian landscapes. He went on his first trip around the world aged just sixteen, repeating the experience five more times throughout his life, trawling the four corners of the earth in search of rare and unknown plant species to show and spread across Europe \u2013 and, most importantly, to display at his marvelous gardens surrounding Villa Taranto, where he lived until the year of his death in1964, aged 80.

They are the two longest glaciers in the Alps: the Great Aletsch Glacier measuring around 23 km and the Fiescher Glacier 14 km long.

Chairlift ascent to the Klingenstock and scenic hike to Fronalpstock with panoramic ridge views as well as extensive views from the mountain house. Valley descent to Stoos again via chairlift. From the Klingenstock, the path leads in westerly direction to Rot Turm and Nollen. A climb to the Huserstock is also an option - or alternatively you hike directly down to Furggeli. The constructed mountain path has in places been cut into the rock face and is secured with chains. Being both stable on your feet and free of vertigo is however highly recommended! Final departure point for possible ascents to the Fronalpstock summit is from the Furggeli mountain hut. Please note the summer timetable for use of the chairlift."

Polished by natural forces, the rock faces have the shape of a human face and the head of a legendary monster. The trail leads to the Saut du Doubs, a spectacular, 27m high waterfall. In Les Brenets, first referred to as Chez le Bruinet in 1325, the industrialisation began in the 18th century. Precision mechanics, particularly watchmaking, experienced a veritable boom here and in Le Locle and it is still an important industrial branch to this day. The tour starts at the train station of Les Brenets. A paved road leads in the direction of the Restaurant Saut-du-Doubs. Along the way, you can see Lac des Brenets below, which was formed by the Doubs River. Through wild, fjord-like ravines with naturally polished rocks you continue to the Saut du Doubs, a 27 metre waterfall. In the winter, when the Doubs is frozen, this is one of Europe\u2019s largest natural ice rinks.  The torrential river forming the border between France and Switzerland soon turns into Lac de Moron, which is smooth as glass. Follow the path above the lake to the wall of the dam. Once past it, the previously open and expansive landscape changes to a lovely environment, but it drops off steeply. This change in the scenery and the moss-covered trees are typical for the Doubs Nature Park.

After about three hours or so, you reach the Torret electric power station. Years ago you could even find glassworks along the Doubs. They were built there because the wood from the area was utilised, but because of the steepness of the terrain, it could not be transported to the villages. For example, the glassworks of Blancheroche used approximately 100 cubic metres of wood per month. Because the glassmakers continued to relocate as soon as the fuel was used up in a particular area, the Neuch\u00e2tel authorities soon prohibited the operation of glassworks on their land.

Descent face to face with the mighty walls of the Grand and Petit Muveran to Ovronnaz and a relaxing time in the thermal spa. Nestled beneath the Les Diablerets massif is the Derborence nature reserve. In 1714 and 1749, enormous masses of rock broke off and fell into the valley of Derborence, where they have since formed a 1.8-kilometre-wide barrier. This created Lac de Derborence and a pioneer forest of larches, mountain pines, birches and spruces. Some trees that survived the landslide are now over 600 years old. The nature reserve of national importance is home to one of the last primaeval mountain forests. At Lac de Derborence begins the long hike to Ovronnaz. You hike uphill into the rocky valley of the Dorbonne. There you follow the stream to Lac de la Forcle. On the way, you pass the Gite de l'alpage de Dorbon, a small mountain restaurant that invites you to take a break. After three and a half hours, you reach Lac de la Forcle. You get to a second small lake and the Glacier de la Forcle on the right lakeshore. Cross the small glacier on the right side before climbing the last 50 metres to Col de la Forcle. At the top, fantastic panoramic views of the Valais's 4000-metre peaks open up. From the Col de la Forcle, you first descend 150 metres, only to climb about a hundred metres again to just below the Cabane Rambert, a hut operated by the Swiss Alpine Club (SAC). The SAC hut offers a place to rest and can be used as an overnight stop to divide the long stage into two days. The views and the idyllic setting around the remote hut are fabulous.  From here, you have 1,200 metres to descend. After a few bends, you reach Plan Salentse, a small high plateau. Follow the stream of the Salentse, which rises slightly above, to the next small plateau at Plan Coupel. The route continues steeply downhill via Le Pessot, where the vegetation begins to change from Saille onwards. Depending on the season, the plain of Saille is dotted with wild flora, sometimes so tall that you can hardly see beyond the path.

If you walk from Romoos through the multilayered Napf area, you might suddenly smell smoke or see mysterious wisps rising from between the trees. Not to worry, it is not a forest fire. It is just the fumes of the smoldering charcoal kilns. The charburners of Romoos are building conical piles of different kinds of wood. Then they light them to generate charcoal. They monitor the process around the clock for a good two weeks. The production of \u201cblack gold\u201d is hard work.  For centuries the farmers have been producing charcoal as a secondary income. Romoos once had around 200 charburning places because blacksmiths, iron foundries and glassworks needed a great deal of charcoal then.

The little-known border area of cantons St. Gallen, Glarus and Graubunden is the best place in the world to observe the processes and evidence of mountain formation. The Tectonic Arena Sardona was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritages because in this region, the processes of mountain formation can be observed more clearly than anywhere else in the world. The key element is the Glarner main thrust fault, a dead straight, magical line, which can be seen along many kilometres: old rock has been thrust over younger rock for a length of 35 kilometres. \u00abWind and weather\u00bb have gnawed at the rock over thousands of years: creating glacier-polished rock, moraine, lakes, gravel and flood plains, their structure still well preserved in the primarily untouched landscapes. The high density of dry grassland, moorland landscapes, flood plains, no-hunting areas and geotopes of national importance form a valuable habitat where in 1911 ibex were first reintroduced into Switzerland after being wiped out in earlier times. Many traces of Walser settlements are still recognisable in the mountain villages. The Sardona-Welterbe-Weg can also be covered in stages.

The little-known border area of cantons St. Gallen, Glarus and Graubunden is the best place in the world to observe the processes and evidence of mountain formation. The Tectonic Arena Sardona was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritages because in this region, the processes of mountain formation can be observed more clearly than anywhere else in the world. The key element is the Glarner main thrust fault, a dead straight, magical line, which can be seen along many kilometres: old rock has been thrust over younger rock for a length of 35 kilometres. \u00abWind and weather\u00bb have gnawed at the rock over thousands of years: creating glacier-polished rock, moraine, lakes, gravel and flood plains, their structure still well preserved in the primarily untouched landscapes. The high density of dry grassland, moorland landscapes, flood plains, no-hunting areas and geotopes of national importance form a valuable habitat where in 1911 ibex were first reintroduced into Switzerland after being wiped out in earlier times. Many traces of Walser settlements are still recognisable in the mountain villages. The Sardona-Welterbe-Weg can also be covered in stages. An accompanying brochure is available for those keen on geology, with information on geology and natural history (www.geopark.ch)."

Through the ever-changing scenery with fantastic views of the surrounding mountains, the trail passes magnificent stone houses, villas and finally the castle of Serravalle. Malvaglia is in the lower Blenio valley, on the east bank of the Brenno river. The trail starts in the picturesque village centre, first crossing the Brenno river and then through the village of Ludiano. Typical along the route are the rustic \u201cgrottos\u201d, or caves, usually located in the shade and a bit off the beaten path. They once were used to store cheese, meat and wine, but nowadays, they are restaurants where local products or a glass of wine are offered. The path heads up through chestnut trees to the ruins of the Selvapiana settlement, which was left to deteriorate in the 20th century. Surprisingly, the village contains some large buildings, in addition to the characteristic Ticino homes. In the Middle Ages, Selvapiana was one of the most important settlements in the entire valley. Around 1900 the population is said to have been almost 300. The ruins of the once thriving village leave a morbid sort of charm.  The route continues to the mountain hamlet of Navone. This is where the oratory of S. Maria Bambina is located, an octagonal baroque construction built around a votive chapel. From the highest point of the route the path continues downhill past the magnificent stone houses of Scarp and leading directly to the village of Semione. The villas here are a testimony to past emigration. After returning home, the emigrants, primarily occupied in commerce and the hospitality industry, built their stately homes along the cantonal road. Before returning to Malvaglia a visit to the ruins of Serravalle castle is well worth it. They are located on a broad rocky ridge north of Semione.

        "description": "This hike in the lower Blenio valley leads up to the ruins of Selvapiana. Through the ever-changing scenery with fantastic views of the surrounding mountains, the trail passes magnificent stone houses, villas and finally the castle of Serravalle. Malvaglia is in the lower Blenio valley, on the east bank of the Brenno river. The trail starts in the picturesque village centre, first crossing the Brenno river and then through the village of Ludiano. Typical along the route are the rustic \u201cgrottos\u201d, or caves, usually located in the shade and a bit off the beaten path. They once were used to store cheese, meat and wine, but nowadays, they are restaurants where local products or a glass of wine are offered. The path heads up through chestnut trees to the ruins of the Selvapiana settlement, which was left to deteriorate in the 20th century. Surprisingly, the village contains some large buildings, in addition to the characteristic Ticino homes. In the Middle Ages, Selvapiana was one of the most important settlements in the entire valley. Around 1900 the population is said to have been almost 300. The ruins of the once thriving village leave a morbid sort of charm.  The route continues to the mountain hamlet of Navone. This is where the oratory of S. Maria Bambina is located, an octagonal baroque construction built around a votive chapel. From the highest point of the route the path continues downhill past the magnificent stone houses of Scarp and leading directly to the village of Semione. The villas here are a testimony to past emigration. After returning home, the emigrants, primarily occupied in commerce and the hospitality industry, built their stately homes along the cantonal road. Before returning to Malvaglia a visit to the ruins of Serravalle castle is well worth it. They are located on a broad rocky ridge north of Semione. Trade and traffic across the Lukmanier Pass were controlled from the once impressive castle. According to archaeological findings, the castle was founded as early as around 900. Surrounded by vineyards, trees and meadows, the path briefly climbs uphill after the ruins before returning to the starting point by the same route."

Today only a few signs of this intense industrial activity remain, as in Le Theusseret shortly before Goumois, the finish of the second stage. Between Les Brenets and Br\u00e9moncourt the Doubs River flows through Switzerland and generally forms the natural border with France along the way. A typical environment in the Doubs Nature Park consists of open woodland pastures alternating with forests, which looks like a mosaic. Over the centuries these areas were developed by livestock farming, horse breeding and forestry. At the northern edge of the plateau, the terrain steeply drops off to the Doubs. The river has formed gorges, some looking like canyons, and as it flows through the valley, it is gentle at times, wild at others. The natural value of this area lies in its exceptional diversity and it provides numerous rare habitats, such as floodplains, wildflower meadows, single trees, hedges, river banks, or the typical forests and woodland pastures mentioned before. The tour begins at La Maison Monsieur. Going slightly uphill and following the lovely path over the heights of the C\u00f4tes du Doubs, you reach Biaufond and the lake of the same name with dozens of swans and ducks. As is typical for most river valleys in karst areas, the canyon offers a particular variety of habitats for flora and fauna: rocky cliffs, scree slopes, high and low water channels, river bends, islands, and backwaters. After Lac de Biaufond, the Doubs turns to the right. The hiking trail now continues uphill and climbs about 100 metres in altitude. It takes at least three more hours to get to La Goule, followed shortly by the La Theusseret forest reserve. It was established in 1992 and at 89 hectares it is one of the ten largest in Switzerland. Nature is left to itself in the reserve. The wood is no longer utilised. Once you pass the power plant, this section of the trail ends in Goumois, after walking about 5 \u00bd hours.

The stage begins at the pier in Morcote, where the boat takes you over the water to Brusino Arsizio in a few minutes. If you'd rather not travel by boat, you can start your hike directly on the other side of the lake. Here, the path quickly leads into the forest, and a steep, varied ascent to Serpiano begins. Alternatively, you can deal with the altitude difference by taking the Brusino Arsizio \u2013 Serpiano cable car. On a plateau on the western slope of Monte San Giorgio lies the Spa Hotel Serpiano. You will soon reach the route's highest point at Casa Doganale, 669 metres above sea level. A slightly descending trail leads on gravel roads and forest paths through the valley between Monte Pravello and Monte San Giorgio to Meride.  Two hundred forty million years ago, there was a 100-metre-deep ocean basin here. Due to numerous spectacular fossil finds, the area was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Some of the finds are on display in the fossil museum in Meride. Nestled between gently rolling hills, the town with its pantile roofs is reminiscent of Tuscany. The buildings have spacious courtyards with porticoes, elaborately laid cobblestones, elegant iron doors and wall fountains.

A 30-metre-high vantage tower giving views over the Alpine foothills to the high Alps. Moutier is surrounded by deep valleys and gorges and wild nature. You can admire excellent glass works of art in the Notre-Dame de la Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t\u00e9 church and the Saint Germain collegiate church. The local precision engineering companies also have a national reputation. The first machine tools were built here and the industry still shapes Moutier today. The hike begins in the valley basin of the Birs. Part of the river flows directly along by the walls of the houses and forms a narrow alley through Moutier. You reach the end of the residential area across the Birs and briefly following the La Chali\u00e8re river. You then ascend on an attractive track at the eastern tip of the Moron. The ridge extends over a length of around 12 kilometres, going from east to west, and averages a width of 2 to 3 kilometres. You reach the broad ridge area through beech and fir forests. Drystone walls stretch in a dead straight line across the hills, and several mountain farms are to be found among the wide-ranging Jura pastures. By the time you reach the hamlet of Pr\u00e9s du Haut de la Charri\u00e8re, half the climb is done. A gravel road now takes you down a gentler incline to Moron Tower. The Ticino architect Mario Botta designed the 30-metre-high building. It was completed in 2004 with the help of around 700 apprentices. The construction was intended to promote the work of bricklayers and stonemasons. There is a spiral staircase with about 190 steps in the impressive tower, with each weighing 400 kg. You cover the final metres to the viewing platform on metal steps inside the tower. Once at the top, you enjoy a spectacular panorama of the Alps from S\u00e4ntis to Mont Blanc, and in the north from the Vosges to the Black Forest. The tower had to be closed temporarily (from summer 2023) when several of the steps broke off in 2022. You reach the highest point of the hike at 1,319 metres. Now a light gravel road running straight through the Jura pastures leads downhill again. Passing molehills, attractive trees and horse pastures, you reach the Pr\u00e8s de la Montagne farm. The trail turns here and heads north to Sornetan. Just 4 kilometres to the west is the former Abbey of Bellelay, where T\u00eate de Moine cheese was developed in the 12th century. The trail now runs through the hamlet of Montagne de Saules and then down to Sornetan on surfaced roads. The village is characterised by its well-maintained church, completed in 1709 and several traditional farms from the 18th and 19th centuries.",

Testimony of the times let hikers' thoughts stray to worlds of a bygone age while at the same time, the Churfirsten mountain range and the deep-blue Lake Walensee are within sight. N\u00e4fels, where the Roman Trail starts near the railway station, lies nestled between steep mountainsides. Across the Upper Linth Canal Bridge, the route leads into neighbouring Mollis with its well-preserved appearance of national importance. The winding alleys feature a mix of workman\u2019s houses, stately manor homes surrounded by extensive gardens, and prestigious, historic buildings. At a moderate grade, the trail then ascends along dry stone walls to the hamlet of Beglingen.  Looking towards the south and west, the steep and impressive mountainsides of the Gl\u00e4rnisch Massif as well as those of Rautispitz and Wiggis, the local mountains of N\u00e4fels and Netstal, respectively, are in full view. The valley opens up towards the north and reveals a view of the Linth Plateau. The trail continues through the Britterwald Forest and climbs up along the Roman bridle path and cart track to the ruins of the Roman look-out and Hotel R\u00f6merturm. A meal there with a wonderful view of the Churfirsten mountain range and Walensee is most inviting after the ascent. The enjoyable hike now takes the form of an elevated trail.

        "description": "In the footsteps of the Romans, the tour leads from N\u00e4fels over Kerenzerberg to M\u00fchlehorn. Testimony of the times let hikers' thoughts stray to worlds of a bygone age while at the same time, the Churfirsten mountain range and the deep-blue Lake Walensee are within sight. N\u00e4fels, where the Roman Trail starts near the railway station, lies nestled between steep mountainsides. Across the Upper Linth Canal Bridge, the route leads into neighbouring Mollis with its well-preserved appearance of national importance. The winding alleys feature a mix of workman\u2019s houses, stately manor homes surrounded by extensive gardens, and prestigious, historic buildings. At a moderate grade, the trail then ascends along dry stone walls to the hamlet of Beglingen.  Looking towards the south and west, the steep and impressive mountainsides of the Gl\u00e4rnisch Massif as well as those of Rautispitz and Wiggis, the local mountains of N\u00e4fels and Netstal, respectively, are in full view. The valley opens up towards the north and reveals a view of the Linth Plateau. The trail continues through the Britterwald Forest and climbs up along the Roman bridle path and cart track to the ruins of the Roman look-out and Hotel R\u00f6merturm. A meal there with a wonderful view of the Churfirsten mountain range and Walensee is most inviting after the ascent. The enjoyable hike now takes the form of an elevated trail. Along dry walls and idyllic meadows, the Roman Trail leads through Filzbach via Reutegg to Obstalden and further on to Walenguflen.

Karst landscape on R\u00e4tschenjoch, former mining area in \u00abButzchammera\u00bb, rockfall landscape in Gafital, scattered settlements on the slopes, at the end a closed-off settlement in St. Ant\u00f6nien Platz. Klosters, a chalet-style alpine resort, lies at the top of the Pr\u00e4ttigau. The village's 800-year history has been shaped by Walserism. The tough, hard-working Walser people are said to have been good-natured, direct, freedom-loving and in tune with nature. With their hard work, they shaped the landscape and people of Graub\u00fcnden. From Klosters railway station, the well-secured trail zigzags steeply up the Schlappintobel. The mountain stream flows below the path. For a few metres, the route continues along Schlappinsee lake, which invites you to fish, splash around and linger. After the tiny Walser settlement of Schlappin, the trail branches off to the left and continues uphill, albeit somewhat less steeply.  Continuing through a fairy-tale forest with beautiful streams, giant mushrooms and lush green grass, you leave the tree line behind. It is worth looking to the east, where the Schlappiner valley now opens up. Wine and cattle, among other things, were traded via the mule track over the Schlappiner-Joch. In 1622, this was a war zone during a conflict between Graub\u00fcnden and Montafon.   Along the steep slope, you reach the Z\u00fcgenh\u00fcttli. At the next junction, the trail continues to the right. Turning left would take you to the Madrisa cable car with its adventure park for families. The long stage could be divided into two parts here.  Further uphill, past the Obers\u00e4ss, you reach the Ch\u00fcecalanda, where the marmots sound the alarm if you get too close. In the back, you can see the three-thousand-metre peaks of the Grisons Alps, the Weissfluh above Klosters and the Pischahorn above Davos. The lush pastures contrast with the stony Saaser-Calanda and the R\u00e4tschenhorn. The hike's highest point is reached at 2,601 metres above sea level. On the R\u00e4tschenjoch, fantastic panoramic views open up to the north and south. The white Gafier Platte suddenly appears right in front of you.  Following the ascent via a lush green southern slope, the route descends again across a gravel landscape on the northern slope. Metre by metre, the scenery turns greener as you leave the Gafier slabs behind you. Affording views of the Madrisajoch and the Gafier Joch, the route continues. A little later, the Sulzfluh and the Drusenfluh are visible to the north. The latter two mountains are suitable for climbing.  Shortly before Hochstelli, at the source of the Gafierbach stream, you look down into the valley over the steeply dropping Plattenfluh. Following along the creek, you reach the Sunnistafel. Rockfalls characterise the primaeval landscape in the lower part of the Gafia valley, making farming difficult. It is still the most important economic sector in the high valley of St. Ant\u00f6nien.

It is actually a fossilised coral reef, once submerged in the primeval Tethys Sea (200 million years ago) \u2013 as plenty of fossils attest. This is one of Switzerland's most famous climbing walls, spanning multiple rope lengths. You then hike uphill towards Anzeinde on mostly broad paths.

From here, you have a stunning view of the steep rock faces beneath the glaciated Diablerets group of mountains. Look up to admire the Alpine view \u2013 and from here on, the hike itself becomes increasingly Alpine. It takes you to Col des Essets pass, which you cross.    After descending through a valley to Alp La Vare, the route climbs again via Sur Champ to La Motte. You need to be sure-footed on this section, which is more challenging in a couple of places. On reaching the top, an enchanting view of the Rhone and Lake Geneva opens up. Then comes a somewhat steeper descent to Solalex, where the hike started.

Across the Turtm\u00e4nna and past the small chapel, forming the border between the hamlets of Gruben and Meiden, the road leads back to the starting point."

The route leads along historic trails through breathtaking nature and intact cultivated landscapes. Hikers gain insights into the culture and history of the Walser folk. The trail begins in the village of San Bernardino. In 1270 the first settlers crossed the pass of the same name from the Valais and settled in Rheinwald. The impressive houses in Hinterrhein, Nufenen and Spl\u00fcgen are a reminder of the days of trading with mule-trains. The Spl\u00fcgenpass, the Safierberg, Passo del S. Bernardino and the Valserberg were important north-south links. The route leads through historic cultivated landscapes and typical scattered Walser settlements. Hiking time for each stage is between 4.5 and 7 hours. But there is plenty of time to enjoy and explore the beautiful landscape. Alpine crossings link the high valleys, along the way the hiker meets clear mountain lakes and high, protected moorlands. The route leads through species-rich Alpine meadows and shady stone pine and larch forests. These impressive natural environments alternate with evidence of Walser pastures and mountain farming. Typical slanted wooden fences, Walser houses burned brown by the sun, log-cabin-style barns and regional building variations such as steeply-pitched roofs in Vals and wood-shingle roofs in the Safiental valley add to the appeal of this long-distance trail.

It is definitely thrilling: with a length of 270 m it connects the two sides of the previously impassable Sementina valley.

After a further interesting journey along the \u00abScheidegg\u00bb with superb views, walk down to the \u00abOchsenalp\u00bb inn. After refreshments in the cosy alpine refuge, you reach the \u00abPr\u00e4tschalp\u00bb via the \u00abRot Tritt\u00bb section. Continue between the upper and lower Pr\u00e4tsch lakes, above the golf course, past the Maran dairy farm, to the final highlight of the round trip, the \u00abEichh\u00f6rnliweg\u00bb, and back to the railway station. The \u00abEichh\u00f6rnliweg\u00bb section is particularly popular with families. Along the way, you will come across some well-maintained fireplaces offering a welcoming respite."

Nature rules here on the pass from Sopra- to Sottoceneri, where forests alternate with pastureland. Tesserete is reached along old tracks and pack-animal trails. Bellinzona is probably Switzerland's most Italian city. Three massive medieval castles dominate the townscape and tell the story of an embattled city. This is because of the city's strategic location in a narrow valley on the way to the Alpine passes of Gotthard, San Bernardino and Lukmanier. Today, modern life flourishes in what is culturally a well-preserved Lombardy town.  From the Bellinzona railway station, the route leads down to the Ticino. Following the leafy river banks, you reach Giubiasco. On the outskirts of town lies the wooded Motto Grande Park with a large playground and biotope. After that, the populated area changes into a secluded, natural environment. A delightful trail leads steeply uphill through the forest to Cima di Dentro at an altitude of 1,000 metres. From here, a path paved in places with natural stones leads through pristine birch forests and between rocks down to Isone, where the Swiss army trains grenadiers and parachute reconnaissance forces. After leaving the village, the route leads uphill again. Small bridges cross over several streams. Until Muricce, the trail is steep in parts and then climbs steadily up to Gola di Lago. Here, the two national routes of the Trans Swiss Trail and the Via Gottardo separate for a short while. Along with Brolla, Indemini, Mezzovico and Gandria, the pass formed a defensive line during the Second World War.  After about six hours of hiking, there's one last descent of just over an hour.

        "description": "Towering 1,679 metres above sea level, Mont Tendre is the highest peak in the Swiss Jura and offers superlative 360-degree panoramic views.  Starting from Col du Mollendruz, the five-hour Mont Tendre Trail climbs 500 metres up Mont Tendre before following a gentle descent to Col du Marchairuz. The route passes through the heart of the Jura Vaudois Nature Park, a firm favourite among leisurely hikers with its 523 kilometres of marked paths. Shortly before the summit, the path up Mont Tendre from Col du Mollendruz offers a treat for weary legs: the   offers a diverse menu of hearty homemade fare in portions designed to satisfy hungry hikers! The restaurant also boasts a huge terrace affording glorious views over Lake Geneva and to the Alps beyond.    This picture-postcard panorama is only surpassed by the 360-degree views from the summit of Mont Tendre, which extend from the Savoy Alps to the Bernese Alps and from the Vosges to La D\u00f4le.    The descent follows a gentle route through park-like surroundings to Col du Marchairuz. Dry-stone walls are a familiar sight in the upland pastures of the Jura. Built to mark out land boundaries and contain grazing animals, these walls also provide an ideal habitat for lizards and insects. The giant colony of carpenter ants on Col du Marchairuz is the only one of its kind in Europe.\u00a0 The Col du Mollendruz and Col du Marchairuz passes are both served by the postal bus."

Following the river La Chali\u00e8re, you walk through the forest and over wooden bridges and stairs. 209 steps lead up to Mario Botta's observation tower on the Moron. At the top: a great view of the Bernese Jura and the mountain range behind. Starting in Perrefitte, the tour follows the Chali\u00e8re, a stream in the Gorges de Perrefitte. The gorge is crossed on natural paths and over wooden bridges and walkways. It passes through a lush forest \u2013 offering some wonderful refreshment. The path is beautifully groomed. You leave the forest at Plain Fahyn via several wooden stairs and follow along the edge of the forest to the heights of the hamlet of Les Ecorcheresses. Here, the path branches off and climbs even more steeply in a gorge through forests and across meadows towards Moron. The famous tower, designed by the renowned Ticino architect Mario Botta, rises before your eyes. A special detail: 700 apprentices were involved in its construction. The project served to promote the masonry profession and as an introduction to stonemasonry. After four years of work and 65,000 working hours, the 30-metre-high, 1,000-tonne tower made of limestone, concrete and steel was inaugurated in 2004. The viewing platform can be reached via 209 steps. The 360\u00b0 panorama extends to the Black Forest, the Vosges, the Jura and the Alps. The names of the peaks are illustrated on eight photo panels. The route back to Perrefitte leads through gentle hilly landscapes and across wooded pastures typical of the region, where horses and cattle graze. Part of the milk produced in this area is used to make the T\u00eate de Moine AOP cheese. The place of origin of this special semi-hard cheese, the village of Bellelay, is situated to the west not far from the tower.

Against the backdrop of the Goms mountains, the Fiescher Glacier becomes clearly visible. The 160-metre-long Aspi-Titter suspension bridge points the way to the idyllic Goms mountain village of Bellwald. Before you leave the Gletscherstube mountain restaurant, be sure to take a last look back in the direction of the Aletsch Glacier. The path takes you past M\u00e4rjelensee Lake before it drops sharply down. After about 30 minutes, near the Burg rocks, the spurs of the Fiescher Glacier appear. An attractive path, some of it challenging, follows across the rocks that have been smoothly polished by the glacier. A few passages are secured with cables, others are provided with very steep metal stairs. Some of the landscape here looks almost like the Grand Canyon. Please note: these metal steps are difficult to climb for small children and dogs. One possibility is to go right at the Burg rocks to bypass the steps.  The suspension bridge is the next highlight along the way. It may also be bypassed by taking the path via Egga below Bellwald. Those who are not bothered by heights will cross the 160 m Aspi-Titter Bridge without a problem. At an altitude of 120 m it spans the Weisswasser Ravine at the foot of Fiescher Glacier, which originally formed the valley.

The path continues on through lush greenery, bordered to the left and right by the moss-covered forest floor. Before heading back to the valley, it takes you to the \u2018Buebeseeli\u2019. This little lake in the middle of the fairytale forest is a true wonderland for children. After leaving the forest, the route carries on to the playground, with a Cerebral Foundation bench. From here, there is a wonderful view of the wide, flat valley floor. It\u2019s a particularly beautiful end to this circular route before it takes you back to the centre of the village."

Biel/Bienne is not only a city where bilingualism is alive and well but also a watchmaking and industrial town. For instance, the Swatch watch company has its headquarters in Biel/Bienne with one of the world's largest timber structures, resembling a gigantic \"Tatzelwurm\". The second stage of the Seeland-Solothurn Trail starts at Biel/Bienne railway station and immediately passes Nidau Castle. The castle was a massive water fortress until late in the 19th century. After the Jura water correction, the water level dropped by around two metres. You cross the Nidau-B\u00fcren canal shortly after the castle at the Port ship lock. The hike now leads along the Aare, which is actually not the Aare itself but bears witness to the Jura water correction and is thus an entirely man-made part of the river, to B\u00fcren an der Aare. In those days, the Aare flowed in broad meanders from Aarberg towards Solothurn. The river's path at the time led to devastating floods, as the water could spread almost unhindered over the flat terrain of the Seeland. The Jura water correction took place between 1868 and 1891. The Aare was diverted into Lake Biel through the construction of the Aare-Hagneck Canal, the Broye and Zihl were straightened and deepened, and the Nidau-B\u00fcren Canal was dug. After about two hours along the canal, the trail crosses the bridge between Orpund and Scheuren. A few minutes later, you reach two hamlets in Meienried, where you cross the Alte Aare, once a mighty river, now just a stream at this point. On the opposite side of the Nidau-B\u00fcren canal lies the H\u00e4ftli nature reserve. Here the Alte Aare makes a semicircle in the direction of the Jura and borders a floodplain-like wetland. From the H\u00e4ftli observation tower, you have magnificent views over the nature reserve. The last hour of hiking takes you to B\u00fcren an der Aare. The beautiful, historic buildings are well worth a short detour into the small town or onto the massive wooden bridge, which was rebuilt after an arson attack in 1989 and inaugurated in 1991.

Dornach is located at the gates of Basel in the Birs Valley, but it is part of the Canton Solothurn. What a way to start this first stage. It has barely begun and here you are looking at the cathedral of Arlesheim. The Roman Catholic church is the landmark of the village and a prominent work of Baroque architecture and interior design. The Arlesheim cathedral was built in 1680/81 and is one of the first major Early Baroque church buildings in Switzerland. A few minutes later you pass Ermitage Arlesheim, the largest landscaped English gardens in Switzerland. A visit is well worth it.

After passing Munimatt you will soon get to the Gempenturm observation tower and Schartenflue Mountain. These form the distinctive edge of the Gempen plateau in the west. In good weather, the observation tower offers a fantastic panorama of the Vosges Mountains, in the direction of the Black Forest and the Swiss Alps. A restaurant is available immediately next to the tower.  Another path takes you to Gempen from here. Once past the small village you reach the Gempen plateau. This Table Jura plateau is located at an altitude between 600 and 700 m and belongs to the Canton Solothurn. It takes almost an hour to cross it, past meadows and through lovely forest sections, leaving the last buildings of Hochwald village behind. About a half hour later, after more meadows and pastures, the walk ends in Seewen. The town is located in the area where the High Chain Jura changes to the Table Jura and it is known for the Museum of Music Automatons.

        "description": "Shortly after setting out, the first highlights appear in the shape of Arlesheim Cathedral and the Ermitage, the most significant English-style landscape park in Switzerland. The trail continues to Seewen through the unrivalled landscape of the Gampen Plateau and its tower vantage point. Dornach is located at the gates of Basel in the Birs Valley, but it is part of the Canton Solothurn. What a way to start this first stage. It has barely begun and here you are looking at the cathedral of Arlesheim. The Roman Catholic church is the landmark of the village and a prominent work of Baroque architecture and interior design. The Arlesheim cathedral was built in 1680/81 and is one of the first major Early Baroque church buildings in Switzerland. A few minutes later you pass Ermitage Arlesheim, the largest landscaped English gardens in Switzerland. A visit is well worth it. Otherwise you will miss the beautiful gardens and the lakes, as they are hidden by the leaves on the trees.

It begins in the village of Jaun, which is known for its refreshing waterfall, its cemetery with its carved wooden crosses and the Cantorama, which was created in the former parish church, dating back to the 13th century, in 1992. The path then crosses into the French-speaking area and heads towards Charmey. Located at the end of the valley dominated by the high peaks of the Hochmatt and the Gros Brun, the delightful village of Charmey has been the main production centre for Gruy\u00e8re AOP cheese since the Middle Ages. Its baths and museum are well worth a visit.  After walking alongside Lake Montsalvens, you will reach the dam of the same name: dating back to 1920, this was the first arch dam in Europe. The path crosses the wild Jogne gorge via wooden bridges and galleries carved into the rock. It is bordered by limestone cliffs and ice pot holes. The village of Broc is home to the pilgrimage chapel of Notre-Dame des Marches, which dates from 1636. Perched on the hillside, in a sumptuous green setting, the mediaeval town of Gruy\u00e8res is renowned for its architecture, history, culture and gastronomy.  Tip: recharge your batteries at the Bains de la Gruy\u00e8re in Charmey, with a magnificent view over the La Gruy\u00e8re mountains. While in Broc, visit the Maison Cailler, the Swiss Chocolate Factory and explore the world of Cailler chocolate.

Once you reach Airolo, the obere Leventina valley awaits with further discoveries. The historic stage to Airolo starts on the most important north-south trans-Alpine route, the language border between German- and Italian-speaking Switzerland and the wellspring of Europe. Even the Romans avoided the Gotthard route, not for the Alps' height, but for the Sch\u00f6llenen Gorge between Andermatt and G\u00f6schenen, which was reputed to be impassable. It all changed with the construction of the Devil's Bridge at the start of the 13th century. At the same time, the muleteer's trail was also improved over its entire length. The pass soon became one of the most important Alpine crossings. From the start, the route first follows the winding Tremola road for 100 metres. It's Switzerland's longest memorial to road construction. Hiking on a path, you will soon find yourself high above the world-famous serpentine road, which on its most spectacular section climbs 300 metres in altitude around 24 bends. To this day, the Tremola road has largely retained the appearance of its reconstruction completed in 1951 \u2013 with granite cobblestones, old drystone walls and the beautiful kilometre stones.  The hiking trail in the Val Tremola winds its way down to the road and along the Foss stream to Motto di Dentro, where you pass under the new mountain pass road. Affording views of the military barracks and the Leventina, the route continues downhill. Airolo, at 1,175 metres above sea level, is known for the southern portal of the railway and motorway tunnels. The countryside surrounding the uppermost village in the Leventina valley also boasts scenic beauty and historic sites: unspoilt villages, an exhibition dairy, idyllic mountain lakes and hiking areas.

Fl\u00fceli-Ranft was the home of the hermit and ascetic Niklaus von Fl\u00fce, also known as Brother Klaus. He had a great deal of influence on 15th-century Switzerland as a politician, mystic and visionary. Fl\u00fceli-Ranft has remained a popular place of pilgrimage to this day. Information panels along the trail provide insight into Niklaus von Fl\u00fce's life and work."

Towering over the path, Les Diablerets and Teufelskegel (devil's basin); an exposed passage (Poteu des Etales), secured by steel ropes into the landslide area of Derborence. Setting off from the H\u00f4tel Restaurant du Sanetsch, hikers will immediately enjoy breathtaking views of the 4,000-metre peaks of the canton of Valais. After climbing just 70 metres, you reach Plan de la Fontaine, where the Le Lachon stream branches off in different directions, creating an idyllic alluvial plain. Shortly after, you find yourself in the Lapis de Zanfleuron, the so-called karst fields, which seem like an extraterrestrial landscape. The trail leads over the bizarre rock formations with an impressive alpine flora below the Zanfleuron glacier. The path soon branches off to the left. A brief climb over a large boulder follows, which can be slippery when wet. You then find yourself in a karst sea, another collection of moon-like rock formations created by the force of the glacier and the weather. The path here requires close attention. If you want to enjoy the beautiful Alpine panorama simultaneously, we recommend you take a short break. After another hour, the scenery changes at Sex Rouge. The name has less to do with red light and more with the Latin word \"saxum\" for rock. Sex Rouge, therefore, means red rock. Here the ground changes from a karst area to lush meadows. By now, you are in the Derborence hunting reserve, where ibex, deer and chamois graze. However, you can also observe golden eagles and many other animals here with a bit of patience. The passage at Poteu du Bois requires some climbing skills. You descend over two ladders into the steep terrain and continue over loose ground using the holding ropes. Surefootedness and a sense of balance are needed. After that, the trail continues steeply downhill but without a safety rope to the La Lizerne de la Mare stream. After about two and a half hours, you reach the stream. The fantastic views over the Derborence are well worth another break. With views of the Lac de Godey and Lac de Derborence reservoirs, the trail leads downhill to the stage's destination of the same name.

The walk begins at La Valsainte Monastery in the Gruy\u00e8re region of Fribourg, which is easy to reach by postbus. The Charterhouse, established in 1295, is the last active Carthusian monastery in Switzerland. The lives of the monks living here in seclusion are dedicated entirely to prayer. The monks are known for their silence and self-imposed solitude, one of the reasons why visits to the inside of the monastery are not permitted, except for a small chapel. But even from the outside, the architecture of the charterhouse with its rows of small buildings is striking. At first, the tour through the pristine Javro Valley heads westward, up to Gite d'Alli\u00e8res. On the way up, the landscape alternates between Alpine meadows and forests. The views of Mt.

The T\u00f6sstal region was created by the huge alluvial fan of the ancient Rhine, lifted during the formation of the Alps. Thus the landscape is dominated by the nagelfluh conglomerate with its loosely packed rock. The T\u00f6sstal streams cut countless rugged ravines into the loose rock. The Z\u00fcri-Oberland-H\u00f6henweg is a hike through this densely forested, often seemingly mysterious, sprawling valley system. Sometimes the trail leads down next to the babbling waters, later almost without exception along summit ridges with fabulous views. At the boundary between Canton Zurich and Toggenburg, the route leads through one of Switzerland\u2019s loveliest pre-Alpine hiking areas.

        "description": "The trail leads from Winterthur through a beautiful pre-Alpine hiking area with rugged valleys, lakes and ridges with wonderful views, crowned by the highest point in Canton Zurich, the Schnebelhorn, and on to Obersee at Rapperswil with its attractive old town. The T\u00f6sstal region was created by the huge alluvial fan of the ancient Rhine, lifted during the formation of the Alps. Thus the landscape is dominated by the nagelfluh conglomerate with its loosely packed rock. The T\u00f6sstal streams cut countless rugged ravines into the loose rock. The Z\u00fcri-Oberland-H\u00f6henweg is a hike through this densely forested, often seemingly mysterious, sprawling valley system. Sometimes the trail leads down next to the babbling waters, later almost without exception along summit ridges with fabulous views. At the boundary between Canton Zurich and Toggenburg, the route leads through one of Switzerland\u2019s loveliest pre-Alpine hiking areas. Along the ridge around Schnebelhorn, the highest of Zurich\u2019s mountains, rows of bold beech trees stand as one. The individual character of the T\u00f6sstal countryside is also reflected in the nature of its inhabitants.

This route consists of five stages and leads through the entire Canton Jura with fascinating landscapes between valleys and mountains, small historic towns and amazing views. From Del\u00e9mont the route follows the ridges and the shore of Lake Lucelle to Porrentruy. The old town with its stately buildings in baroque, gothic and neo-classical style is well worth a visit. And so is the majestic castle from the Middle Ages, which dominates the city. The third historic town in the Canton Jura is St-Ursanne, also known as the \u201cpearl of the Jura\u201d. Especially attractive is the view from the four-arched stone bridge spanning the Doubs of the medieval town with its monastery and the church.  A lovely, flat path then meanders across the meadows and along the banks of the river, all the way to Tariche, where we cross the Doubs near the holiday centre and subsequently the mountain. The route follows the path commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Canton Jura, which was founded in 1979. It passes the rock where the three regions of the canton meet. The views from the ridge of the Del\u00e9mont and Doubs valleys are marvellous. Before taking the route down to Glovelier, the World War I defence structures should not be missed.  The last section leads through the Combe Tabeillon nature preserve. The scenery along the Tabeillon river alternates between meadows, ponds, ravines and forests.

The latter was built in 1698 at an altitude of close to 1000 m and offers gorgeous views of the Einsiedeln mountain valley."

Besonders eindr\u00fccklich ist die Kathedrale mit ihren wundersch\u00f6nen Glasfenstern und dem 74 Meter hohen Aussichtsturm. Sind die 365 Treppenstufen erklommen, bietet sich ein wunderbarer Blick \u00fcber die gesamte Stadt und die Freiburger Voralpen. Sie erstrecken sich in den Kantonen Freiburg, Bern und Waadt \u00fcber die deutsch-franz\u00f6sische Sprachgrenze. Die Landschaft ist mit ihren Gebirgen, Seen, Naturschutzgebieten und von Gletschern geschaffenen Urlandschaften vielf\u00e4ltig.  Die Etappe beginnt am Freiburger Bahnhof und f\u00fchrt zun\u00e4chst durch die engen Gassen der historischen Altstadt bis zur Kathedrale. Nach dem Abstieg zur Sense \u00fcberquert man die letzte gedeckte Holzbr\u00fccke der Stadt. Die Bernbr\u00fccke wurde bei einem Angriff der Berner 1340 zers\u00e4gt, um dem Feind den Weg abzuschneiden. Nun folgt der Aufstieg neben der Gott\u00e9ron-Schlucht und an Felsw\u00e4nden entlang hoch zum rechteckigen D\u00fcrrenbuhlturm. Am Turm vorbei gelangt man zwischen Wald und Siedlungsgebiet zur Kirche Notre Dame de Bourguillon. Der Ort ist beliebt bei Pilgern und war im Mittelalter Zufluchtsort f\u00fcr Menschen, die an Lepra erkrankt waren. Es folgt ein sch\u00f6ner Weg durch Weide- und Waldabschnitte in der h\u00fcgeligen Landschaft des Senselandes bis nach St. Ursen.  Die Wanderung f\u00fchrt weiter \u00fcber ein aussichtsreiches Plateau nach Rechthalten. Die hiesige Pfarrkirche St. German war nach einem Blitzeinschlag niedergebrannt und 1768 wieder eingeweiht worden. Bereits 1784 wurde ihr Holzschindeldach von einem Schuss getroffen, woraufhin die halbe Kirche erneut abbrannte. Zur Gemeinde geh\u00f6ren die Hochmoore Entemoos und Rotmoos. Aus den beiden Naturschutzgebieten wurde fr\u00fcher Torf gestochen. \u00dcber schmale Pfade und Treppen wird der h\u00f6chste Punkt der Route, das Buechench\u00e4ppeli erreicht. Auf Schotter- und Asphaltstrassen geht es weiter nach Plaffeien. Die sch\u00f6nen Alpen bleiben immer im Blickfeld. Kurz vor dem Etappenende wird die Grenze zum Naturpark Gantrisch erreicht, wo neben Naturerlebnissen auch die Biodiversit\u00e4t und die Dunkelheit gef\u00f6rdert werden. In Plaffeien angekommen, f\u00e4llt die gr\u00f6sste neuromanische Kirche des Kantons ins Auge. Der lebhafte Ort gilt als das wirtschaftliche Zentrum des Sense-Oberlandes.  Fribourg est une ville universitaire m\u00e9di\u00e9vale bilingue avec onze fontaines historiques, plus de 200 fa\u00e7ades gothiques et beaucoup de charme. La cath\u00e9drale avec ses magnifiques vitraux et sa tour de 74 m\u00e8tres de haut est particuli\u00e8rement impressionnante. Une fois les 365 marches gravies, vous aurez une superbe vue sur toute la ville et les Pr\u00e9alpes fribourgeoises. Celles-ci s\u2019\u00e9tendent sur les cantons de Fribourg, de Berne et de Vaud, \u00e0 travers la fronti\u00e8re linguistique franco-allemande. Le paysage est vari\u00e9 avec ses montagnes, ses lacs, ses r\u00e9serves naturelles et ses paysages primitifs cr\u00e9\u00e9s par les glaciers. L\u2019\u00e9tape commence \u00e0 la gare de Fribourg et m\u00e8ne d\u2019abord \u00e0 travers les ruelles \u00e9troites de la vieille ville historique jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la cath\u00e9drale. Apr\u00e8s la descente \u00e0 la Singine, on traverse le dernier pont en bois couvert de la ville. Le pont de Berne a \u00e9t\u00e9 sci\u00e9 lors d\u2019une attaque des Bernois en 1340 afin de couper la route \u00e0 l\u2019ennemi. On s\u2019attaque maintenant \u00e0 la mont\u00e9e \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des gorges du Gatt\u00e9ron et le long des parois rocheuses jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la Tour de D\u00fcrrenb\u00fchl, de forme rectangulaire. Apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 la tour, on rejoint entre la for\u00eat et la zone d\u2019habitation l\u2019\u00e9glise Notre-Dame de Bourguillon. L\u2019endroit est tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 des p\u00e8lerins et \u00e9tait au Moyen \u00c2ge un lieu de refuge pour les personnes atteintes de la l\u00e8pre. S\u2019ensuit un beau chemin \u00e0 travers des parties de for\u00eats et de p\u00e2turages dans le paysage vallon\u00e9e de la Singine jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Saint-Ours. La randonn\u00e9e se poursuit sur un plateau avec une belle vue sur Dirlaret. L\u2019\u00e9glise paroissiale locale de Saint-Germain avait br\u00fbl\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9e par la foudre, avant d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e0 nouveau consacr\u00e9e en 1768. Mais en 1784, son toit en bardeaux de bois fut touch\u00e9 par un coup de feu, ce qui entra\u00eena alors un nouvel incendie de la moiti\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9glise. Les hauts-marais de l\u2019Entemoos et du Rotmoos font partie de la commune. La tourbe \u00e9tait autrefois extraite de ces deux r\u00e9serves naturelles. En montant par des sentiers \u00e9troits et des escaliers, on atteint le point culminant de l\u2019itin\u00e9raire, le Buechench\u00e4ppeli. Puis la randonn\u00e9e se poursuit sur des chemins de terre et des routes goudronn\u00e9es jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Plaffeien avec les belles Alpes constamment en ligne de mire. Peu avant la fin de l\u2019\u00e9tape, on atteint la fronti\u00e8re du Parc naturel de Gantrisch, o\u00f9, en plus de la d\u00e9couverte de la nature, on promeut \u00e9galement la biodiversit\u00e9 et l\u2019obscurit\u00e9 naturelle. Arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 Plaffeien, le regard est attir\u00e9 par la plus grande \u00e9glise n\u00e9o-romane du canton. Cette localit\u00e9 anim\u00e9e est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme le centre \u00e9conomique de l\u2019Oberland singinois. Friburgo \u00e8 una citt\u00e0 universitaria medievale bilingue con undici fontane storiche, oltre 200 facciate gotiche e molto fascino. La cattedrale, con le sue bellissime vetrate e la torre panoramica alta 74 metri, \u00e8 particolarmente suggestiva. Una volta saliti i 365 scalini, si gode di una splendida vista su tutta la citt\u00e0 e sulle Prealpi friburghesi. Queste ultime si estendono oltre il confine linguistico tedesco-francese nei cantoni di Friburgo, Berna e Vaud. Il paesaggio \u00e8 variegato e presenta montagne, laghi, riserve naturali e paesaggi plasmati dai ghiacciai.  La tappa inizia alla stazione ferroviaria di Friburgo e si snoda dapprima attraverso le strette vie del centro storico fino alla cattedrale. Dopo la discesa verso il fiume Sense, si attraversa l'ultimo ponte di legno coperto della citt\u00e0. Il ponte di Berna fu fatto a pezzi durante un attacco dei bernesi nel 1340 per bloccare la strada al nemico. Segue ora la salita accanto alle gole del Gott\u00e9ron e lungo le pareti rocciose fino alla torre rettangolare di D\u00fcrrenbuhl. Superata la torre, procedendo tra il bosco e l'abitato, si raggiunge la chiesa di Notre Dame de Bourguillon. Questo luogo \u00e8 molto amato dai pellegrini e nel Medioevo era un rifugio per i malati di lebbra. Uno splendido sentiero attraversa i pascoli e le foreste della regione collinare di Sense fino a St. Ursen.  L'escursione prosegue su un altopiano panoramico fino a Rechthalten. La chiesa parrocchiale locale di St. German bruci\u00f2 dopo essere stata colpita da un fulmine e fu nuovamente consacrata nel 1768. Poco dopo, nel 1784, il suo tetto in scandole di legno fu colpito da un proiettile, dopodich\u00e9 mezza chiesa fu nuovamente bruciata. Le torbiere in quota di Entemoos e Rotmoos fanno parte di questo comune. Anticamente, da queste due riserve naturali si estraeva la torba. Seguendo stretti sentieri e scale si raggiunge il punto pi\u00f9 elevato del percorso, la cappella Buechench\u00e4ppeli. Si prosegue lungo strade sterrate e asfaltate fino a Plaffeien. Le splendide Alpi sono una costante di questo paesaggio. Poco prima della fine della tappa, si raggiunge il confine con il Parco naturale del Gantrisch, dove oltre alle esperienze naturalistiche si promuovono la biodiversit\u00e0 e il buio. Una volta giunti a Plaffeien, salta all'occhio la pi\u00f9 grande chiesa neoromanica del cantone. Questa vivace localit\u00e0 \u00e8 considerata il centro economico dell'altopiano della regione di Sense. Fribourg is a bilingual medieval university town with eleven historic fountains, over 200 Gothic facades and plenty of charm. The cathedral, with its beautiful glass windows and the 74-metre-high viewing tower, is awe-inspiring. Once you have climbed the 365 steps, lovely views over the entire city and the Fribourg Pre-Alps beckon. They stretch across the German-French language border in the cantons of Fribourg, Bern and Vaud. The countryside is stunning and diverse, with its mountains, lakes, nature reserves, and primaeval landscapes created by glaciers.  The stage begins at Fribourg railway station and initially leads through the narrow alleyways of the historic old town to the cathedral. After descending to the Sense, you cross the last covered wooden bridge in the city. The Bern Bridge was sawn up during an attack by the Bernese in 1340 to cut off the enemy's way. Now comes the ascent beside the Gott\u00e9ron gorge and along rock faces up to the rectangular D\u00fcrrenbuhl tower. Passing the tower, you reach the Notre Dame de Bourguillon church between the forest and settlement area. The place is popular with pilgrims and was a refuge for people suffering from leprosy in the Middle Ages. A beautiful path follows through pasture and forest sections in the hilly landscape of the Senseland to St. Ursen.  Over a plateau with superb views, the hike continues to Rechthalten. The local parish church of St. German burnt down after being struck by lightning and was consecrated again in 1768. As early as 1784, its wooden shingle roof was hit by a bullet, after which half the church burnt down again. The Entemoos and Rotmoos upland moors are part of the municipality. Peat used to be cut from the two nature reserves. The route's highest point, the Buechench\u00e4ppeli, is reached via narrow paths and stairs. Continue on gravel and asphalt roads to Plaffeien. The magnificent Alps are always in sight. Shortly before the end of the stage, you reach the border to the Gantrisch Nature Park, where biodiversity and darkness are promoted in addition to nature experiences. Arriving in Plaffeien, the largest neo-Romanesque church in the canton catches the eye. The lively town is considered the economic centre of the Sense Oberland.",

Die Bernbr\u00fccke wurde bei einem Angriff der Berner 1340 zers\u00e4gt, um dem Feind den Weg abzuschneiden. Nun folgt der Aufstieg neben der Gott\u00e9ron-Schlucht und an Felsw\u00e4nden entlang hoch zum rechteckigen D\u00fcrrenbuhlturm. Am Turm vorbei gelangt man zwischen Wald und Siedlungsgebiet zur Kirche Notre Dame de Bourguillon. Der Ort ist beliebt bei Pilgern und war im Mittelalter Zufluchtsort f\u00fcr Menschen, die an Lepra erkrankt waren. Es folgt ein sch\u00f6ner Weg durch Weide- und Waldabschnitte in der h\u00fcgeligen Landschaft des Senselandes bis nach St. Ursen.  Die Wanderung f\u00fchrt weiter \u00fcber ein aussichtsreiches Plateau nach Rechthalten. Die hiesige Pfarrkirche St. German war nach einem Blitzeinschlag niedergebrannt und 1768 wieder eingeweiht worden. Bereits 1784 wurde ihr Holzschindeldach von einem Schuss getroffen, woraufhin die halbe Kirche erneut abbrannte. Zur Gemeinde geh\u00f6ren die Hochmoore Entemoos und Rotmoos. Aus den beiden Naturschutzgebieten wurde fr\u00fcher Torf gestochen. \u00dcber schmale Pfade und Treppen wird der h\u00f6chste Punkt der Route, das Buechench\u00e4ppeli erreicht. Auf Schotter- und Asphaltstrassen geht es weiter nach Plaffeien. Die sch\u00f6nen Alpen bleiben immer im Blickfeld. Kurz vor dem Etappenende wird die Grenze zum Naturpark Gantrisch erreicht, wo neben Naturerlebnissen auch die Biodiversit\u00e4t und die Dunkelheit gef\u00f6rdert werden. In Plaffeien angekommen, f\u00e4llt die gr\u00f6sste neuromanische Kirche des Kantons ins Auge. Der lebhafte Ort gilt als das wirtschaftliche Zentrum des Sense-Oberlandes.  Fribourg est une ville universitaire m\u00e9di\u00e9vale bilingue avec onze fontaines historiques, plus de 200 fa\u00e7ades gothiques et beaucoup de charme. La cath\u00e9drale avec ses magnifiques vitraux et sa tour de 74 m\u00e8tres de haut est particuli\u00e8rement impressionnante. Une fois les 365 marches gravies, vous aurez une superbe vue sur toute la ville et les Pr\u00e9alpes fribourgeoises. Celles-ci s\u2019\u00e9tendent sur les cantons de Fribourg, de Berne et de Vaud, \u00e0 travers la fronti\u00e8re linguistique franco-allemande. Le paysage est vari\u00e9 avec ses montagnes, ses lacs, ses r\u00e9serves naturelles et ses paysages primitifs cr\u00e9\u00e9s par les glaciers. L\u2019\u00e9tape commence \u00e0 la gare de Fribourg et m\u00e8ne d\u2019abord \u00e0 travers les ruelles \u00e9troites de la vieille ville historique jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la cath\u00e9drale. Apr\u00e8s la descente \u00e0 la Singine, on traverse le dernier pont en bois couvert de la ville. Le pont de Berne a \u00e9t\u00e9 sci\u00e9 lors d\u2019une attaque des Bernois en 1340 afin de couper la route \u00e0 l\u2019ennemi. On s\u2019attaque maintenant \u00e0 la mont\u00e9e \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des gorges du Gatt\u00e9ron et le long des parois rocheuses jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la Tour de D\u00fcrrenb\u00fchl, de forme rectangulaire. Apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 la tour, on rejoint entre la for\u00eat et la zone d\u2019habitation l\u2019\u00e9glise Notre-Dame de Bourguillon. L\u2019endroit est tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 des p\u00e8lerins et \u00e9tait au Moyen \u00c2ge un lieu de refuge pour les personnes atteintes de la l\u00e8pre. S\u2019ensuit un beau chemin \u00e0 travers des parties de for\u00eats et de p\u00e2turages dans le paysage vallon\u00e9e de la Singine jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Saint-Ours. La randonn\u00e9e se poursuit sur un plateau avec une belle vue sur Dirlaret. L\u2019\u00e9glise paroissiale locale de Saint-Germain avait br\u00fbl\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9e par la foudre, avant d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e0 nouveau consacr\u00e9e en 1768. Mais en 1784, son toit en bardeaux de bois fut touch\u00e9 par un coup de feu, ce qui entra\u00eena alors un nouvel incendie de la moiti\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9glise. Les hauts-marais de l\u2019Entemoos et du Rotmoos font partie de la commune. La tourbe \u00e9tait autrefois extraite de ces deux r\u00e9serves naturelles. En montant par des sentiers \u00e9troits et des escaliers, on atteint le point culminant de l\u2019itin\u00e9raire, le Buechench\u00e4ppeli. Puis la randonn\u00e9e se poursuit sur des chemins de terre et des routes goudronn\u00e9es jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Plaffeien avec les belles Alpes constamment en ligne de mire. Peu avant la fin de l\u2019\u00e9tape, on atteint la fronti\u00e8re du Parc naturel de Gantrisch, o\u00f9, en plus de la d\u00e9couverte de la nature, on promeut \u00e9galement la biodiversit\u00e9 et l\u2019obscurit\u00e9 naturelle. Arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 Plaffeien, le regard est attir\u00e9 par la plus grande \u00e9glise n\u00e9o-romane du canton. Cette localit\u00e9 anim\u00e9e est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme le centre \u00e9conomique de l\u2019Oberland singinois. Friburgo \u00e8 una citt\u00e0 universitaria medievale bilingue con undici fontane storiche, oltre 200 facciate gotiche e molto fascino. La cattedrale, con le sue bellissime vetrate e la torre panoramica alta 74 metri, \u00e8 particolarmente suggestiva. Una volta saliti i 365 scalini, si gode di una splendida vista su tutta la citt\u00e0 e sulle Prealpi friburghesi. Queste ultime si estendono oltre il confine linguistico tedesco-francese nei cantoni di Friburgo, Berna e Vaud. Il paesaggio \u00e8 variegato e presenta montagne, laghi, riserve naturali e paesaggi plasmati dai ghiacciai.  La tappa inizia alla stazione ferroviaria di Friburgo e si snoda dapprima attraverso le strette vie del centro storico fino alla cattedrale. Dopo la discesa verso il fiume Sense, si attraversa l'ultimo ponte di legno coperto della citt\u00e0. Il ponte di Berna fu fatto a pezzi durante un attacco dei bernesi nel 1340 per bloccare la strada al nemico. Segue ora la salita accanto alle gole del Gott\u00e9ron e lungo le pareti rocciose fino alla torre rettangolare di D\u00fcrrenbuhl. Superata la torre, procedendo tra il bosco e l'abitato, si raggiunge la chiesa di Notre Dame de Bourguillon. Questo luogo \u00e8 molto amato dai pellegrini e nel Medioevo era un rifugio per i malati di lebbra. Uno splendido sentiero attraversa i pascoli e le foreste della regione collinare di Sense fino a St. Ursen.  L'escursione prosegue su un altopiano panoramico fino a Rechthalten. La chiesa parrocchiale locale di St. German bruci\u00f2 dopo essere stata colpita da un fulmine e fu nuovamente consacrata nel 1768. Poco dopo, nel 1784, il suo tetto in scandole di legno fu colpito da un proiettile, dopodich\u00e9 mezza chiesa fu nuovamente bruciata. Le torbiere in quota di Entemoos e Rotmoos fanno parte di questo comune. Anticamente, da queste due riserve naturali si estraeva la torba. Seguendo stretti sentieri e scale si raggiunge il punto pi\u00f9 elevato del percorso, la cappella Buechench\u00e4ppeli. Si prosegue lungo strade sterrate e asfaltate fino a Plaffeien. Le splendide Alpi sono una costante di questo paesaggio. Poco prima della fine della tappa, si raggiunge il confine con il Parco naturale del Gantrisch, dove oltre alle esperienze naturalistiche si promuovono la biodiversit\u00e0 e il buio. Una volta giunti a Plaffeien, salta all'occhio la pi\u00f9 grande chiesa neoromanica del cantone. Questa vivace localit\u00e0 \u00e8 considerata il centro economico dell'altopiano della regione di Sense. Fribourg is a bilingual medieval university town with eleven historic fountains, over 200 Gothic facades and plenty of charm. The cathedral, with its beautiful glass windows and the 74-metre-high viewing tower, is awe-inspiring. Once you have climbed the 365 steps, lovely views over the entire city and the Fribourg Pre-Alps beckon. They stretch across the German-French language border in the cantons of Fribourg, Bern and Vaud. The countryside is stunning and diverse, with its mountains, lakes, nature reserves, and primaeval landscapes created by glaciers.  The stage begins at Fribourg railway station and initially leads through the narrow alleyways of the historic old town to the cathedral. After descending to the Sense, you cross the last covered wooden bridge in the city. The Bern Bridge was sawn up during an attack by the Bernese in 1340 to cut off the enemy's way. Now comes the ascent beside the Gott\u00e9ron gorge and along rock faces up to the rectangular D\u00fcrrenbuhl tower. Passing the tower, you reach the Notre Dame de Bourguillon church between the forest and settlement area. The place is popular with pilgrims and was a refuge for people suffering from leprosy in the Middle Ages. A beautiful path follows through pasture and forest sections in the hilly landscape of the Senseland to St. Ursen.  Over a plateau with superb views, the hike continues to Rechthalten. The local parish church of St. German burnt down after being struck by lightning and was consecrated again in 1768. As early as 1784, its wooden shingle roof was hit by a bullet, after which half the church burnt down again. The Entemoos and Rotmoos upland moors are part of the municipality. Peat used to be cut from the two nature reserves. The route's highest point, the Buechench\u00e4ppeli, is reached via narrow paths and stairs. Continue on gravel and asphalt roads to Plaffeien. The magnificent Alps are always in sight. Shortly before the end of the stage, you reach the border to the Gantrisch Nature Park, where biodiversity and darkness are promoted in addition to nature experiences. Arriving in Plaffeien, the largest neo-Romanesque church in the canton catches the eye. The lively town is considered the economic centre of the Sense Oberland."

        "text": "Sentier du Talent A beautiful hiking tour in the forest along the Talent River. It is particularly well suited for families and can be done any time of the year. It offers a wide variety of flora and fauna as well as impressive structures, such as Montheron Abbey, old mills and waterwheels. Echallens extends on both sides of the Talent River on a plateau of the central Gros de Vaud district. The area in the Vaud midlands is also known as the region\u2019s breadbasket. The \u201cMaison du Ble et du Pain\u201d in the centre of Echallens highlights the history of wheat and bread. The heart of the village also comprises some lovely mansions and patrician homes from the 17th to the 19th century. The walk starts on the other side of the train station, near the tennis courts, where it enters the forest. The trail continuously follows the river after which the hike has been named. The source of the Talent River, a tributary to the Orbe, is in the Bois du Jorat forest area. The Talent and the Orbe merge into the Thielle River which flows into Lake Neuch\u00e2tel. The upper and middle parts of the Talent are largely natural or near-natural, including in the Bois de la Commune forest where the trail leads to the Malapalud farming village. The kids will enjoy the wide variety of flora and fauna along the river, especially since native animals are often spotted here. The second part of this flat and easy hike runs through the Bois aux Allemandes via Cugy to Montheron. The distance of just under 10 km allows various side trips to nearby places of interest. Channels and waterwheels, for example, are found in Echallens, Assens, Bretigny and Cugy. Those in Echallens are now used for trout farming. In Assens, a restaurant is located next to an 18th century mill. Some of the buildings close to the route are also of interest, such as the Montheron Abbey, one of the last examples of Cistercian architecture in the Canton Vaud. The Moulin de Cugy is an old, completely renovated mill whose original condition was preserved. It houses a restaurant and an art gallery. Art is also the focus of the \u201cL\u2019Escpace Culturel Assens\u201d museum. All towns and villages along the route are easy to reach with public transportation and therefore ideal for a visit.",

Once the 1,909-metre-high peak has been climbed, however, summiteers are rewarded with a fantastic panoramic view from the Jura chain across the Swiss Plateau to Mont Blanc. The starting point of the demanding circular hike on the Teysachaux is the bus station Les Rosalys in  , a holiday paradise at 1,000 metres above sea level, situated between Fribourg and Vevey. The route first leads comfortably uphill through wooded areas towards Mol\u00e9son. Before the La Pudze turnoff, the forest gives way to open meadows, allowing a clear view of the dreamy landscape of the Fribourg Region.  After winding its way over a steeper passage, the trail continues over relatively flat terrain to Villard-Dessous, where it turns onto the red mountain hiking trail towards Tremetta. The remaining ascent of 450 metres in altitude proves to be increasingly challenging. Important: Follow the stony path of the white-red-white trail marking. A short stop at Alp Tremetta is well worthwhile. From here you can catch a glimpse of the Teysachaux summit cross. Once the ridge is reached, it\u2019s focus, focus, focus.

The pristine, lovely Schwarzsee, changing colour from turquoise to black, depending on the light, is both start and destination. The Schwarzsee, nestled in the foothills of the Fribourg Alps, looks dark. Legend has it that the water appears almost black since a giant washed his feet in it. The village of the same name extends along the western and northern shore of the Schwarzsee. The area located directly on the border between French- and German-speaking Switzerland is a popular destination, especially for those living in Fribourg and Bern. Surrounded by a majestic backdrop, including Kaiseregg, Spitzflue and the spotlight of this hike, the Schwyberg Mountains, the trail starts at the Hostellerie stop. From there it follows the lakeshore to Schwarzsee Bad on a level course. The ascent across meadows and through a scattering of trees turns at the edge of a forest. Shortly thereafter Fuchses Schwyberg is reached, an open peak with amazing views across the Schwarzsee Valley and the Kaiseregg, Spitzflue, Mol\u00e9son and La Berra mountains. A relatively flat section follows before the trail descends slightly toward Alp Hapferen Schwyberg. On the ridge in the direction of Gross Schwyberg the peak of Kaiseregg reappears and the views open up. Even Fribourg\u2019s fascinating Poya Bridge with its stay cables can be glimpsed in the distance. The highest point of the route offers a 360-degree panoramic view of 13 cantons. The descent on the hiking trail to the Gurli mountain restaurant starts near the Gross Schwyberg mountain hut. Follow the signs toward Holzena and Lichtena. The last part of the walk undulates along the shore of the Warme Sense River. The latter originates in the Schwarzsee and joins the Kalte Sense River near Zollhaus. From there on the river is called Sense and flows into the Saane River near Laupen.

The hike to Valle del Salto starts on the left side of the Maggia River. The trail leads through the centre of the village of Maggia, for which the valley in the Ticino is named, and past terraced vineyards.

The chapel was built in the late Middle Ages and the views from here across the village and the valley are marvellous.  A beautifully restored pathway then follows, some of it provided with large flagstones and stone steps. A small votive chapel in Braiaa contains frescoes by Giovanni Antonio Vanoni (1818-1886).

The highland is located at an altitude of 2,300 meters on the border between Ticino (high  \n                                 Rich in water that overflows from the ground creating streams, rivers, ponds and little swamps, the Greina region is crossed by old trails. In fact, it was  an area of transit and pastures already during the Roman days and in the Middle Age. Only one sign of the ancient presence of humans is seen at the centre of the highland: the Crap la Crusch (stone of the cross), a boulder that bears a metal cross on its summit. During the summer, short but intense, the highland offers beautiful flowers in bloom thanks to the diversity of the Alpine flora. It is even possible to have close encounters with groundhogs and other animals typical of the alpine regions. The easiest and most popular itinerary to the Greina starts from Campo Blenio-Ghirone. Here you take a bus to Pian Geirett at an altitude of 2,000 meters. Then, in about an hour ascent, you reach the Scaletta cabin with its traditional pointed roof. Slightly above, there is a vast highland that opens up for the visitor with immense spaces, grey or dark rocks, miniscule flowers, mosses, lichens and water courses that wind through the rocks. It takes an additional 30 minutes to reach the Greina Pass and another hour to Crap la Crusch. A distinctive trait of the region is the natural arch of stone that can be admired on a detour from the main trail. From Crap la Crusch in about half an hour you can reach the Motterascio plain, ploughed by numerous streams and slightly below the namesake cabin. From here, along a long and steep descent, walk to the Luzzone dam where the bus stop to return to the departure point in Campo Blenio is located ( ).   There are three Alpine cabins in the region (Scaletta, Motterascio, Terri) offering room and board. We recommend making reservations for an overnight stop.

The highland is located at an altitude of 2,300 meters on the border between Ticino (high  \n                                 Rich in water that overflows from the ground creating streams, rivers, ponds and little swamps, the Greina region is crossed by old trails. In fact, it was  an area of transit and pastures already during the Roman days and in the Middle Age. Only one sign of the ancient presence of humans is seen at the centre of the highland: the Crap la Crusch (stone of the cross), a boulder that bears a metal cross on its summit. During the summer, short but intense, the highland offers beautiful flowers in bloom thanks to the diversity of the Alpine flora. It is even possible to have close encounters with groundhogs and other animals typical of the alpine regions. The easiest and most popular itinerary to the Greina starts from Campo Blenio-Ghirone. Here you take a bus to Pian Geirett at an altitude of 2,000 meters. Then, in about an hour ascent, you reach the Scaletta cabin with its traditional pointed roof. Slightly above, there is a vast highland that opens up for the visitor with immense spaces, grey or dark rocks, miniscule flowers, mosses, lichens and water courses that wind through the rocks. It takes an additional 30 minutes to reach the Greina Pass and another hour to Crap la Crusch. A distinctive trait of the region is the natural arch of stone that can be admired on a detour from the main trail. From Crap la Crusch in about half an hour you can reach the Motterascio plain, ploughed by numerous streams and slightly below the namesake cabin. From here, along a long and steep descent, walk to the Luzzone dam where the bus stop to return to the departure point in Campo Blenio is located ( ).   There are three Alpine cabins in the region (Scaletta, Motterascio, Terri) offering room and board. We recommend making reservations for an overnight stop. The bus service Campo Blenio-Pian Geirett and Luzzone-Campo Blenio is scheduled from the beginning of July to the end of September.\n                                "

The Breggia Gorge offers a fascinating walk discovering the wonders of the landscape. The old Ghitello mill of 1606, located behind the parking lot of the Breggia Shopping Centre in Balerna, is one of the departure points. The trail leads to the little lake and continues along the river with some factories scattered on the way, including a cement factory and a brewery. After crossing the Breggia, the trail ascends the valley to the San Pietro hill where ruins of a medieval castle and the Chiesa Rossa (Red Church) can be seen. The church dates back to the 14th century and is decorated with beautiful frescos (visits can be arranged). Following the indicated trail, you will be lead down to the bridge Punt da Canaa. Along the way you can observe rocks that are clearly stratified: they are the park's most ancient ones (190 million year-old flint limestone). Your will then be led to cross a deep and narrow gorge by means of a recently built bridge and proceed onto the right bank. You will still be surrounded by the layers of rock, crossing some singular biotopes, and will finally return to the Ghitello mill where more recent deposits are visible (Tertiary and Quaternary). Upon request, the Park organizes guided tours and educational activities specifically for schools, whereas in the summer the local tourist office offers tours to the public. Offered only as a guided tour, it is possible to follow another itinerary in the Park of the Breggia Gorge but it is rather difficult to combine it with the first option. The Cement course is the most visible element of ex-cement factory Saceba's redevelopment, located at the entrance of the Breggia Gorge and part of the namesake geological park. In 1972-1973, during the period of peak production, Saceba produced up to 200'000 tons of cement a year for a total of over 2 million tons in approximately 20 years of activity. The educational tour uses the structures of the old factory to illustrate the transformation process of rock into cement. The itinerary takes place along a 2 km trail: from the open air caves to the tunnels used to extract the material, to the mill where the rock was ground and ending at the oven towers, the heart of the cement factory used today as an exhibit and educational space. The temperature in the tunnels is cool (10-13\u00b0C) and humidity high (over 80%). It is therefore recommended to dress appropriately.

This interesting project in wood and stone was designed by the father of Ticino's modern architecture, Rino Tami. The building is equipped with seven nice rooms, two dormitories and a camping ground with three yurts (Mongolian tents) from which guests can observe the stars at night. There is also a restaurant that offers a variety of local products such as the excellent alpine Lucomagno  . According to its promoters, the importance of the Centre does not revolve around the structure itself but rather around the emotions and joy that it brings to its guests and to those who want to discover the nature of the region. The Lucomagno - from Latin  , big sacred forest - is in fact a unique place. Over the course of the centuries humankind has also contributed to enrich the beauty of the landscape creating open spaces and fields of flowers in bloom at altitudes where there would otherwise only be forest. Centuries of alpine farmers' labor have in fact replaced the forest with fields and pastures to fodder livestock, the main source of income in these alpine conditions. The suggested itinerary crosses exactly these fields where rare plants and flowers appear every summer offering a captivating color palette. Behind the hotel there is also an important cantonal forestry reserve (Selvasecca) with a substantial presence of the Swiss stone pine. All the necessary information to discover the region can be found at the Pro Natura Centre that also organizes a vast cultural program and guided tours. In the Lucomagno region there are itineraries accessible to all. We have chosen, from the many possible walks, a simple yet gratifying one for the beauty of the scenery. This walk invites you to discover the region of D\u00f6tra, between Olivone and the Lucomagno Pass. The summer makes the meadows bloom enveloping them in colorful flower corollas: a true spectacle that enchants visitors. The richness and the variety of the D\u00f6tra flora have been known for some time and the region is part of the Federal Inventory of Landscapes and Natural Monuments worthy of protection. The itinerary starts from Acquacalda, where the Pro Natura Centre is located, at approximately 1,750 meters. The path winds its way through the pine forests and quickly leads to the Croce Portera plain (1,917 meters) where the large cross invites passerby to a moment of silence and reflection. An enjoyable path of flowery meadows leads to the settlement of D\u00f6tra. Daisies, lilies, gentians, arnica, buttercups, wild orchids, anemones and other flowers compose unforgettable sceneries, especially between the months of June and July. In the area you may also spot various species of butterflies, other insects and around fifty species of nesting birds. The landscape is majestic, with high mountain peaks, flowery basins and rocks that emerge from the green surroundings. Aside from the so-called   (skinny fields) - with a soil poor in nutrition but rich in plant species - also present in the region are humid zones with great ecological interest. In D\u00f6tra there is a cabin that is open year-round and is the starting point for more demanding excursions. There\u2019s also a   that offers an traditional dishes. The trail continues towards Anv\u00e9uda a small conglomeration of houses set in a panoramic location.

Every year at the beginning of spring, a large exhibit celebrates this flower. The walk that from Locarno leads to Tenero, pleasant and leveled, is a tourists' favourite. From the pier you first walk along the lakeside of Muralto through blooming aisles and a beautiful Mediterranean vegetation, continuing then \u2013 still along Lake Maggiore \u2013 to Rivapiana. This neighbourhood has a handful of houses decorated by frescoes and characterized by a high tower of the San Quirico church. Of Romanesque origin, it is in a beautiful location accessible from the lakeside through a signposted passage; inside, fragments of a fresco are preserved. Located next to the church (on the western side) and surrounded by a nice park is Villa San Quirico, a building from the 1930s and now owned by the town of Minusio. Continuing along the lakeshore you reach the Ca\u2019 di Ferro (Iron House), an imposing building from the 1500s historically used as barracks with many chimneys and barred windows.

From the pier you first walk along the lakeside of Muralto through blooming aisles and a beautiful Mediterranean vegetation, continuing then \u2013 still along Lake Maggiore \u2013 to Rivapiana. This neighbourhood has a handful of houses decorated by frescoes and characterized by a high tower of the San Quirico church. Of Romanesque origin, it is in a beautiful location accessible from the lakeside through a signposted passage; inside, fragments of a fresco are preserved. Located next to the church (on the western side) and surrounded by a nice park is Villa San Quirico, a building from the 1930s and now owned by the town of Minusio. Continuing along the lakeshore you reach the Ca\u2019 di Ferro (Iron House), an imposing building from the 1500s historically used as barracks with many chimneys and barred windows.

Along the marked path that winds through the valley of the Magliasina-river between Novaggio, Ponte di Vello and Aranno, there are several attractions of historical, natural and scenic interest: from the evidence of human activities (dry stone walls, mills and a water powered trip hammer) to a wetland environment abounding in several noteworthy species of flora and fauna. Among the wonders of this trail there are the remains of an old castle and the mines where gold was once extracted.\n                                 \n                                The Malcantone region offers an interesting, pleasant variety of landscapes, stretching from the shores of the lake to the summit of Monte Lema, passing through hills dotted with beautiful villages and large woodland areas. The local tourist board has been a pioneer in the creation of thematic and educational itineraries designed to help visitors explore more popular as well as less travelled areas, allowing them to discover traces of old buildings and the evidence of human activities connected to agriculture, husbandry and the exploitation of all types of natural resources. The Trail of Marvels is a 7-kilometre, family-friendly, circular route (about four hours walk) that starts and ends in Novaggio. The itinerary is particularly interesting for those who wish to encounter testimonies of the area\u2019s past. Along the marked trail, that winds through the valley of the Magliasina-river between Novaggio, Ponte di Vello and Aranno, there are several points highlighting several characteristics of the region, including the dry stone walls that marked the boundaries of properties, terraces where farmers used to grow rye, kilns for firing bricks and roof tiles (a common activity in Malcantone) and mills for grinding grains and chestnuts. Also of particular interest are the various species of flora and fauna found in the area, including insects, reptiles, birds and rodents and, in the riverside woodland, alder, ash, maple, and hawthorn trees. However, what is most likely going to capture your attention is what remains of a singular activity, namely the extraction of minerals. On the way you will encounter traces of the mines where small amounts of gold and silver, but of also zinc and sulphur, were found in the 19th century, together with signs of soil probes related to mining, abandoned in the early 20th century. Another gem of the trail is the Aranno trip hammer, the only water-powered lever trip hammer that still exists in Switzerland, and which was, in fact, operative until 1951. Iron was manufactured and various tools were produced thanks to the force of the water that operated it. An exhibition housed on the top floor tells the trip hammer\u2019s story. The trip hammer is generally open to the public from May to October; however, in case of rain it remains closed.   The remains of a castle are also visible along the way, positioned on what was probably an old communication route forming part of a fortified line along the Magliasina valley. Shaded by a thick forest, the site hosts a playground and a picnic area.  The Trail of Wonders is also accessible from Aranno, Ponte di Vello (where you can find an agritourism) and Miglieglia. In order to follow the route more easily, we recommend downloading the informative   featuring a map of the area from the website of the Lugano Region Tourism Office.

The local tourist board has been a pioneer in the creation of thematic and educational itineraries designed to help visitors explore more popular as well as less travelled areas, allowing them to discover traces of old buildings and the evidence of human activities connected to agriculture, husbandry and the exploitation of all types of natural resources. The Trail of Marvels is a 7-kilometre, family-friendly, circular route (about four hours walk) that starts and ends in Novaggio. The itinerary is particularly interesting for those who wish to encounter testimonies of the area\u2019s past. Along the marked trail, that winds through the valley of the Magliasina-river between Novaggio, Ponte di Vello and Aranno, there are several points highlighting several characteristics of the region, including the dry stone walls that marked the boundaries of properties, terraces where farmers used to grow rye, kilns for firing bricks and roof tiles (a common activity in Malcantone) and mills for grinding grains and chestnuts. Also of particular interest are the various species of flora and fauna found in the area, including insects, reptiles, birds and rodents and, in the riverside woodland, alder, ash, maple, and hawthorn trees. However, what is most likely going to capture your attention is what remains of a singular activity, namely the extraction of minerals. On the way you will encounter traces of the mines where small amounts of gold and silver, but of also zinc and sulphur, were found in the 19th century, together with signs of soil probes related to mining, abandoned in the early 20th century. Another gem of the trail is the Aranno trip hammer, the only water-powered lever trip hammer that still exists in Switzerland, and which was, in fact, operative until 1951. Iron was manufactured and various tools were produced thanks to the force of the water that operated it. An exhibition housed on the top floor tells the trip hammer\u2019s story. The trip hammer is generally open to the public from May to October; however, in case of rain it remains closed.   The remains of a castle are also visible along the way, positioned on what was probably an old communication route forming part of a fortified line along the Magliasina valley. Shaded by a thick forest, the site hosts a playground and a picnic area.  The Trail of Wonders is also accessible from Aranno, Ponte di Vello (where you can find an agritourism) and Miglieglia.

Continuing to Brione, the route crosses an area where the creation of an art trail (\"Sentiero per l\u2019arte\") was tried out a few years ago. A few sculptures by contemporary Swiss and international artists can still be glimpsed, set in a truly delightful natural context. Different works in terms of style, technique and materials (ceramics, wood, metal, glass, stone). As expected, some of the sculptures have \"fused\" with vegetal and mineral presences of the place, while others have conserved their original aspect. The path continues, past old buildings and chapels adorned with naive frescoes, small bridges, waterfalls and flowering meadows. You might even have a chance to spot some wolf traps on the way, which were used in the past. This leads to the last village, Sonogno, which is home to the House of Wool (\"Casa della lana\") and the Ethnographic Museum, that collects the memories of the valley and the history of the chimney sweepers.  Accessible in both directions from late spring until deep into autumn, the \"Sentierone\" does not present any difficulties. The entire trail is however quite challenging for its length (about 8 hours). But it is possible to split it or to walk along it in small segments.  In summer you can benefit of different spots to jump into the refreshing, green waters of the  .   During the winter months and at the beginning of spring, in some parts of the route the terrain can be slippery; while crossing streams can be difficult because of the amount of water due to the melting of snow in the high mountains or to heavy rain.

Today, it is a very popular walk with hikers because of the beauty of the landscape through the woods and along the river\u2019s emerald-coloured waters. Also groups and families appreciate very much this trail because it is easy and adaptable to different needs: in fact, it can be walked along its entire length or only a part of it, with easy access to the numerous public transport stops for the return journey.\n                                 \n                                 The itinerary ( ) can start either in Mergoscia or at the Verzasca  . In the first case you get to   by walking halfway up the hillside above the artificial lake; in the second case, you go through the numerous hamlets of Vogorno before reaching the crossroad \u201cBivio di Corippo\u201d. From here a flat stretch leads to the village of  , extremely popular for the double-arched bridge and for its wonderful pools of emerald green water. Continuing to Brione, the route crosses an area where the creation of an art trail (\"Sentiero per l\u2019arte\") was tried out a few years ago. A few sculptures by contemporary Swiss and international artists can still be glimpsed, set in a truly delightful natural context. Different works in terms of style, technique and materials (ceramics, wood, metal, glass, stone). As expected, some of the sculptures have \"fused\" with vegetal and mineral presences of the place, while others have conserved their original aspect. The path continues, past old buildings and chapels adorned with naive frescoes, small bridges, waterfalls and flowering meadows. You might even have a chance to spot some wolf traps on the way, which were used in the past. This leads to the last village, Sonogno, which is home to the House of Wool (\"Casa della lana\") and the Ethnographic Museum, that collects the memories of the valley and the history of the chimney sweepers.  Accessible in both directions from late spring until deep into autumn, the \"Sentierone\" does not present any difficulties. The entire trail is however quite challenging for its length (about 8 hours). But it is possible to split it or to walk along it in small segments.  In summer you can benefit of different spots to jump into the refreshing, green waters of the  .   During the winter months and at the beginning of spring, in some parts of the route the terrain can be slippery; while crossing streams can be difficult because of the amount of water due to the melting of snow in the high mountains or to heavy rain.

The Museum of fossils of Monte San Giorgio presents the important paleontological heritage of the region, wich ist considered one of the most important fossil deposits in the world and registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The fossils of San Giorgio are famous for their variety and their exceptional state of preservation. The exhibit is meant for a vast public and thanks to multimedia technologies, it allows non-experts to immerse themselves into the complex world of the Triassic.\n                                 \n                                 The highlights of the exhibit are the animal and plant fossils accompanied by short explanations based on current knowledge, as well as a number of three-dimensional models and graphic reconstitution of the marine environment of the time. In fact, during the Middle Triassic (247-236 million years ago), the   was not the same mountain we know today, but rather a fairly shallow ocean floor. The environment was defined by the presence of small islands and sand banks that separated the coast from open waters, forming a sort of lagoon. The difference with other deposits of world renown - that usually present a sole fossil level attributed to a precise moment in geological history - the Monte San Giorgio has uncovered at least five different levels, each of which can contain more than one fossil association. This particular aspect allows the study of evolution over the course of millions of years, from determined groups of organisms in the same environment. From these five levels, over 20 thousand fossils have been extracted. In total, 25 species of reptiles, 50 species of fish and over 100 invertebrates, next to different species of plants, in particular coniferous, can be counted. The exhibition concept is centred on the community of organisms from the five main levels of fossils of the Triassic period. On the first floor, following the stratigraphic succession of the mountain, are the most ancient fossils while on the second floor the most recent ones. On the third floor fossils and rocks from the Jurassic period originating from the neighbouring marble cave of Arzo are presented, 50-60 million years younger than the objects exposed on the first two floors. The exhibit closes with the history of the paleontological excavations, that began in the middle of the 19th century. Threedimensional animations in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) reveal to visitors a long lost world. The museum, designed by Ticino architect Mario Botta, provides visitors with multimedia audio guides, touch screens with animations about the evolution of reptiles, fish and of the land from sea to mountain. It also offers a model of the San Giorgio on which all sorts of information can be projected on command by the user. Among the activities offered by the museum there is also has a vast program of conferences and guided tours. Upon request it is possible to take a tour with a trained guide, not only inside the museum but also outside, on the territory.\n                                ",

The exhibit is meant for a vast public and thanks to multimedia technologies, it allows non-experts to immerse themselves into the complex world of the Triassic.\n                                 \n                                 The highlights of the exhibit are the animal and plant fossils accompanied by short explanations based on current knowledge, as well as a number of three-dimensional models and graphic reconstitution of the marine environment of the time. In fact, during the Middle Triassic (247-236 million years ago), the   was not the same mountain we know today, but rather a fairly shallow ocean floor. The environment was defined by the presence of small islands and sand banks that separated the coast from open waters, forming a sort of lagoon. The difference with other deposits of world renown - that usually present a sole fossil level attributed to a precise moment in geological history - the Monte San Giorgio has uncovered at least five different levels, each of which can contain more than one fossil association. This particular aspect allows the study of evolution over the course of millions of years, from determined groups of organisms in the same environment. From these five levels, over 20 thousand fossils have been extracted. In total, 25 species of reptiles, 50 species of fish and over 100 invertebrates, next to different species of plants, in particular coniferous, can be counted. The exhibition concept is centred on the community of organisms from the five main levels of fossils of the Triassic period. On the first floor, following the stratigraphic succession of the mountain, are the most ancient fossils while on the second floor the most recent ones. On the third floor fossils and rocks from the Jurassic period originating from the neighbouring marble cave of Arzo are presented, 50-60 million years younger than the objects exposed on the first two floors. The exhibit closes with the history of the paleontological excavations, that began in the middle of the 19th century. Threedimensional animations in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) reveal to visitors a long lost world. The museum, designed by Ticino architect Mario Botta, provides visitors with multimedia audio guides, touch screens with animations about the evolution of reptiles, fish and of the land from sea to mountain. It also offers a model of the San Giorgio on which all sorts of information can be projected on command by the user. Among the activities offered by the museum there is also has a vast program of conferences and guided tours. Upon request it is possible to take a tour with a trained guide, not only inside the museum but also outside, on the territory.\n                                "

The calm of the village, located at 900 meters and accessible only on foot or via the cable car mounting up from Verdasio, the harmony of its stone buildings and the silence that lingers in the lovingly cared-for vegetable gardens and yards are what make this a very special place. Surrounding the little church dedicated to Saint Anne stand old rural and noblemen's homes. A stop at the grotto (tavern) is a must before going back with the cable car or before descending on foot  to the beautiful village of Palagnedra, through the old hamlet of Bordei.\n                                 \n                                 In the past, the village of Rasa was located lower, in the area now called Terra Vecchia, which you will cross when following the itinerary to Palagnedra. Over the centuries the inhabitants abandoned the old village and moved to the one we know today. The reason for this move is intriguing and is related to emigration. In 1631, after about fifty Bergamese and Valtellina laborers quit their jobs at the Livorno border, some emigrants from Rasa together with others from Palagnedra, Ronco and Terree di Pedemonte, were fortunate to take their place marking the beginning of an era of prosperity and well-being in the little town of Rasa. In fact, those emigrants built elegant houses and financed religious buildings in the village's new abode located on a plain in a beautiful position. The church of Saint Anne dates back to the first half of the 1700s. As in the case of the other hamlet Bordei, over time the ancient village of Terra Vecchia was being reclaimed by nature and reduced to a collection of ruins, but both villages have been renovated by the Terra Vecchia Foundation dedicated to the recovery and rehabilitation of drug addicts.  Up to 1958, when the current cable car was built, the village was isolated from the world and still today the atmosphere in Rasa is far removed from our society's frenetic lifestyle. If you still have some time left after visiting Rasa, we recommend the interesting walk to Palagnedra, a village rich in rustic and noble architecture, beyond the pictorial art. Go down towards Terra Vecchia, where the namesake Foundation has carried out the reconstruction of the old centre. When you reach the creek, climb up towards Bordei - another hamlet that breathes a new life thanks to the work coordinated by the Foundation - finally arriving in Palagnedra. The village counts numerous rustic houses adjacent to noble ones, a tangible trace of a successful emigration. In the choir of the old church of San  Michele an impressive collection of frescoes by Antonio da Tradate from the 1400s is preserved. Descend towards the remarkably green artificial lake and along the road you will have a chance to admire metal sculptures of the artist Alain Garnier. Once you reach the train station, you may return to   with the   or go back to the starting point at the Verdasio cable car.

The building is equipped with seven nice rooms, two dormitories and a camping ground with three yurts (Mongolian tents) from which guests can observe the stars at night. There is also a restaurant that offers a variety of local products such as the excellent alpine Lucomagno  . According to its promoters, the importance of the Centre does not revolve around the structure itself but rather around the emotions and joy that it brings to its guests and to those who want to discover the nature of the region. The Lucomagno - from Latin  , big sacred forest - is in fact a unique place. Over the course of the centuries humankind has also contributed to enrich the beauty of the landscape creating open spaces and fields of flowers in bloom at altitudes where there would otherwise only be forest. Centuries of alpine farmers' labor have in fact replaced the forest with fields and pastures to fodder livestock, the main source of income in these alpine conditions.

The itinerary starts from Acquacalda, where the Pro Natura Centre is located, at approximately 1,750 meters. The path winds its way through the pine forests and quickly leads to the Croce Portera plain (1,917 meters) where the large cross invites passerby to a moment of silence and reflection. An enjoyable path of flowery meadows leads to the settlement of D\u00f6tra. Daisies, lilies, gentians, arnica, buttercups, wild orchids, anemones and other flowers compose unforgettable sceneries, especially between the months of June and July. In the area you may also spot various species of butterflies, other insects and around fifty species of nesting birds. The landscape is majestic, with high mountain peaks, flowery basins and rocks that emerge from the green surroundings. Aside from the so-called   (skinny fields) - with a soil poor in nutrition but rich in plant species - also present in the region are humid zones with great ecological interest.

In the Mendrisiotto region, along the river Breggia, one can observe exceptional geological contents. Thanks to the river's natural excavation activity a geology profile has been brought to light covering the period between the Jurassic and Tertiary, dating back 80 million years! Within these rocks are live testimonials of ancient seas:  \n                                 Switzerland's first GeoPark located between the communes of Balerna, Castel San Pietro, Morbio Inferiore and Morbio Superiore, is rich in natural or manmade testimonials of great interest even to those that don't have specific knowledge of the subject. The Breggia Gorge offers a fascinating walk discovering the wonders of the landscape. The old Ghitello mill of 1606, located behind the parking lot of the Breggia Shopping Centre in Balerna, is one of the departure points. The trail leads to the little lake and continues along the river with some factories scattered on the way, including a cement factory and a brewery. After crossing the Breggia, the trail ascends the valley to the San Pietro hill where ruins of a medieval castle and the Chiesa Rossa (Red Church) can be seen. The church dates back to the 14th century and is decorated with beautiful frescos (visits can be arranged). Following the indicated trail, you will be lead down to the bridge Punt da Canaa. Along the way you can observe rocks that are clearly stratified: they are the park's most ancient ones (190 million year-old flint limestone). Your will then be led to cross a deep and narrow gorge by means of a recently built bridge and proceed onto the right bank. You will still be surrounded by the layers of rock, crossing some singular biotopes, and will finally return to the Ghitello mill where more recent deposits are visible (Tertiary and Quaternary). Upon request, the Park organizes guided tours and educational activities specifically for schools, whereas in the summer the local tourist office offers tours to the public. Offered only as a guided tour, it is possible to follow another itinerary in the Park of the Breggia Gorge but it is rather difficult to combine it with the first option. The Cement course is the most visible element of ex-cement factory Saceba's redevelopment, located at the entrance of the Breggia Gorge and part of the namesake geological park. In 1972-1973, during the period of peak production, Saceba produced up to 200'000 tons of cement a year for a total of over 2 million tons in approximately 20 years of activity. The educational tour uses the structures of the old factory to illustrate the transformation process of rock into cement. The itinerary takes place along a 2 km trail: from the open air caves to the tunnels used to extract the material, to the mill where the rock was ground and ending at the oven towers, the heart of the cement factory used today as an exhibit and educational space. The temperature in the tunnels is cool (10-13\u00b0C) and humidity high (over 80%). It is therefore recommended to dress appropriately. Helmets, headlamps and reflective jackets are provided on the spot. It's an easy walk although not recommended for people suffering from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, claustrophobia, epilepsy or other serious handicaps.\n                                ",
