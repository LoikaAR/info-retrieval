    #             "A clear autumn morning, shortly after the Malojapass, picturesque surroundings: the gold and dark green of the conifers contrasting with the deep-blue of the sky and snow-white of the summits. Before you lies the Sentiero Panoramico Val Bregaglia, a fantastic high-Alpine hike through one of Switzerland's most remote valleys.",
    #             "It soon becomes clear that you are hiking on historic paths. The first sign is the 200-year-old ramp on the Roman \u00abMal\u00f6gin\u00bb trading route. Shortly afterwards you cross the monumental Gothic walls of the S. Gaudenzio church ruins. At the beginning some of the unmistakeable hallmarks of civilization succeed in diverting you: the pass road, the mighty dam on the Albigna reservoir, the power lines suspended through the valley like silver threads. But then you enter the silent world of an extensive mixed forest. The path scales the sunny south slope of the valley to become a high-level trail.",

Opposite, enormous granite spikes soar into the sky: the summit of the Sciora group and the Piz Badile - your constant companions on this high-level trail - exude an air of eternity. Equally solid, the granite slabs that pave the path, cross water courses and lead down skilfully-laid steps towards the valley. The silhouettes of the stone roofs in Soglio reveal themselves in the evening sun. The destination is a museum-like village with the history-steeped Hotel Palazzo and exquisite chestnut specialities, or to quote the artist Segantini: \u00abthe threshold to paradise\u00bb.",
