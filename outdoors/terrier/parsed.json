At the beginning some of the unmistakeable hallmarks of civilization succeed in diverting you: the pass road, the mighty dam on the Albigna reservoir, the power lines suspended through the valley like silver threads.

Equally solid, the granite slabs that pave the path, cross water courses and lead down skilfully-laid steps towards the valley. The silhouettes of the stone roofs in Soglio reveal themselves in the evening sun.

The building was restored after it was destroyed by a fire in 1734. Four mills were in operation at that time, including a sawmill and a forge. The mills are named after Abraham-Louis Calame.

Because the glassmakers continued to relocate as soon as the fuel was used up in a particular area, the Neuch\u00e2tel authorities soon prohibited the operation of glassworks on their land.

            "On 26 September 1799, Suvorov arrived with his troops in Altdorf. The threatening mountains and gloomy ravines faded into the background on the broad valley plain. However, not the entire army had made it to Altdorf, and many soldiers were exhausted from the exertions. Hunger compounded the situation. The supply train had stayed behind, and the French had largely plundered the country. ",
            "The fifth stage of the ViaSuworow is, first and foremost, dedicated to Switzerland's national hero, starting at the Tell monument in the centre of Altdorf. The bronze statue, inaugurated in 1895, presents William Tell with his crossbow shouldered together with his son, Walter. After a short walk through the old town and past the industrial area of Altdorf, you reach B\u00fcrglen after about half an hour. The beautiful Marienkirche of \"burgulione\" was first mentioned in a document in 817. The name B\u00fcrglen comes from the Latin burgus (castle). Right next to the church is the Tell Museum. Continuing through residential quarters and along dry-stone walls for another hour, you arrive at Br\u00fcgg. ",
            "There was no way for Suvorov to march from Altdorf via Fl\u00fcelen directly to Schwyz or Lucerne. The lake would have been the only connection, but all the ships had been taken away by the French. Therefore, despite overtired troops, he set out for Muotathal the following day. The night of 27 September was rainy and cold. At higher altitudes, there was even some snow. Remarkably, Suvorov ordered his exhausted and starving troops over the pass, given that the equipment, especially the footwear, had also been severely affected on the way to Altdorf. ",
            "Today's hiking boots are much more comfortable. For about 45 minutes, the trail leads along the Sch\u00e4chen valley to Gr\u00fcndli, where the occasionally steep 900-metre ascent begins. Scenic paths and cattle trails, partly enclosed by old dry-stone walls or a stile fence, climb to an altitude of over 1,600 metres above sea level. Along the way: magnificent views over the Reuss valley and the surrounding peaks of T\u00f6di, Gross Windg\u00e4llen and Gross Spannort. The stage ends on the sun terrace at Biel-Chinzig.",

In 1714 and 1749, enormous masses of rock broke off and fell into the valley of Derborence, where they have since formed a 1.8-kilometre-wide barrier. This created Lac de Derborence and a pioneer forest of larches, mountain pines, birches and spruces. Some trees that survived the landslide are now over 600 years old. The nature reserve of national importance is home to one of the last primaeval mountain forests.",

On the way, you pass the Gite de l'alpage de Dorbon, a small mountain restaurant that invites you to take a break. After three and a half hours, you reach Lac de la Forcle.

The SAC hut offers a place to rest and can be used as an overnight stop to divide the long stage into two days. The views and the idyllic setting around the remote hut are fabulous. ",

Follow the stream of the Salentse, which rises slightly above, to the next small plateau at Plan Coupel. The route continues steeply downhill via Le Pessot, where the vegetation begins to change from Saille onwards. Depending on the season, the plain of Saille is dotted with wild flora, sometimes so tall that you can hardly see beyond the path.",

            "Round trip hike in the picturesque region of the Diemtigtal. An unique mountain range with luscious green meadows, small waterfalls and little springs.",
            "The tour begins at Grimmialp and leads along Senggibach creek, which leisurely flows through pastures and lovely meadows. The scattered farms are soon behind you and at W\u00fcrzi you enter the forest. On shaded, pleasantly cool forest trails you continue up to Alp Grimmi. When you get to the mountain restaurant of the same name, you\u2019re probably ready for a break. If you\u2019re lucky you might even catch a glimpse of some chamois balancing between the steep grass slopes on the mountainside.",
            "Shortly thereafter you approach the mystical place of Grimmiwasser. While the water of the mineral spring is colourless, the iron dissolved in the water settles on the underground and provides a rusty red colour. Long ago, the Alpine herdsmen of the Diemtigtal Valley told their neighbours from the Simmental Valley about the healing powers of the Red Spring located all the way in the back of the Diemtigtal. The healing spring water was known far beyond the small mountain valley. For particularly serious illnesses, the water was picked up in barrels, jugs and bottles at the alp, even in winter and under very difficult circumstances. Because of the spring\u2019s healing powers Grimmialp became a health resort in the 19th century. For a few years, a water line was installed to transport the water directly from the spring to what was the Grimmialp sanatorium at that time.",
            "From the spring you continue in the direction of Stierenberg where you have an excellent view of the impressive cliff of the Fromattgrat peak. The path descends via Alp Nidegg. Those who wish to avoid the descent of about 400 altitude meters continue to the Grimmialp mountain station and take the convenient chairlift down to the valley."

The massive Weisshorn pyramid (4505 m) towers on the horizon with other 3000 and 4000 m peaks of the Valais forming the backdrop. Small villages and sleepy hamlets with their typical sun-darkened huts are visible down in the valley.",

From the village the path rises through a meadow up to the edge of the forest. It crosses the track of the cog railway and enters the first larch forest. High above the valley it traverses the bridges over several mountain streams along the slope. After the Oberbach bridge it climbs a few meters up to the information board describing the panorama. Here at 1712 m is the highest point of the Gommer high-altitude trail. The chance to observe wildlife is particularly good in the forests protecting the villages in the valley against avalanches, falling rocks and landslides.",
            "Finally, a short downhill section to reach M\u00fcnster, the main town of the Goms region. With its intricate, typical Goms houses the village has gained national importance. The old larch-wood huts were built on stakes to protect them from gnawing rodents. Of course, the other villages in the Obergoms region are also worth a visit. It takes less than 30 minutes to reach the high-altitude trail from any of them. Interesting hiking options are available as the Matterhorn Gotthard railway stops at every village. Note: In its entire length, the Gommer H\u00f6henweg leads almost 29 kilometres from Oberwald to Bellwald. The trail can be done in a 2-day tour or divided into individual stages.

            "If you walk from Romoos through the multilayered Napf area, you might suddenly smell smoke or see mysterious wisps rising from between the trees. Not to worry, it is not a forest fire. It is just the fumes of the smoldering charcoal kilns. The charburners of Romoos are building conical piles of different kinds of wood. Then they light them to generate charcoal. They monitor the process around the clock for a good two weeks. The production of \u201cblack gold\u201d is hard work. ",
            "For centuries the farmers have been producing charcoal as a secondary income. Romoos once had around 200 charburning places because blacksmiths, iron foundries and glassworks needed a great deal of charcoal then. Nowadays, the ancient craft is practiced by just a few farmers from the Napf area. They still produce as much as 100 tons every year. Making air holes, adding burnable material, extracting charcoal \u2013 with a bit of luck, you might be able to peek over the workers\u2019 shoulders on the hike between Romoos and Bramboden.

The Segnesboden waterfall connects the two areas and flows through a deep rock crevice into the scree landscape on the left side of the trail. From here it joins the Flem, which you follow all the way to the village of Flims. A narrow wooden bridge crosses it on the way to the Segnes hut.",

The hikers are very close to this impressive structure, which is perfectly embedded in the terrain. They cross this awe-inspiring road with retaining walls of as much as 8 m multiple times and in some places they even walk on it.

You see the Gotthard highway down in the valley and the new road across the pass. Crossing under a viaduct brings the former Motto Bartola defence structure into view, now a Swiss Army base. A narrow mountain trail leads past it and continues through meadows and short forest areas. The last section of the path down to Airolo offers a fantastic view of the Leventina Valley and the surrounding mountains. The trail passes through the lovely old town centre with its winding lanes and heads for the train station below. Airolo is a crossroads of traffic routes from different eras: the old 13th century mule track, the old railway tunnel which opened in 1882 and the Gotthard road tunnel, built approximately 100 years later.

It is also a wintering site for rare birds such as the merlin, Eurasian curlew and several species of goose. The BirdLife nature centre in La Sauge is a good place to stop. ",

From Sugiez, the path continues towards Murten, via the Chablais forest. Numerous observation towers offer you the chance to admire the wildlife along the banks. ",

This involves following the path that continues downhill to the left after the watering hole. For those not prone to vertigo, the direct route to Rionada offers an unforgettable panorama: as you emerge from the forest, the view opens out onto Mont Dolent, the border mountain between Switzerland, France and Italy, as well as the Trient massif, Mont Blanc and the Dents du Midi. Not forgetting the Rhone Valley as far as Lake Geneva.",

A further 200 metres of ascent over slate scree takes you to the Col des Perris Blancs at 2544 metres. From the pass, continue to climb to your right towards the Pointe des Martinets and continue along a somewhat airy path, partially secured by chains, to the Col des Martinets. The long descent from the col takes you to the bottom of the Nant valley and continues along the L'Avancon de Nant torrent to Pont de Nant. At the end of this stage, the table is laid and you find a well-deserved soft bed.

The effort of the ascent is rewarded with an overwhelming view: the jagged peaks of the Garzen and the Wandelhorn tower up on the horizon along with the Engelh\u00f6rner on the other side. Equally unique: the Gyrensprung (1887 m. a.s.l.), whose shape is reminiscent of a ski jump to heaven. Once you have crossed Switzerland's best-preserved high moor, you reach the top of the Wandelalp.

Author Conan Doyle was also taken with this natural spectacle, especially as he had his main characters Sherlock Holmes and his arch-enemy Professor Moriarty plunge down the waterfall in battle."

The Romans used the route to get to the Alps\u2019 richest thermal springs in Leukerbad.

About 300 m of it are exposed, but the trail is wide, easy to hike and secured with steel cable where exposed.

They were taken by surprise, leading to roughly one company's capture. Some Frenchmen managed to escape to Schwyz. Village priest Lukas Geisser recalls the events: After the French had been put to flight, two horsemen armed with spears, sabres, and a pistol headed up the hill towards him. Another 30 soldiers soon followed them. The officer leading them came up to him, opened his uniform jacket and showed him the large cross on his chest. In broken German, he said: \"We also good Christians, we enemies of the French, you also, we therefore friends.\"",

            "On the Moron ridge stands the Tour de Moron, designed by Mario Botta and built by 700 apprentice bricklayers and stonemasons in 2004. A 30-metre-high vantage tower giving views over the Alpine foothills to the high Alps.",
            "Moutier is surrounded by deep valleys and gorges and wild nature. You can admire excellent glass works of art in the Notre-Dame de la Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t\u00e9 church and the Saint Germain collegiate church. The local precision engineering companies also have a national reputation. The first machine tools were built here and the industry still shapes Moutier today.",
            "The hike begins in the valley basin of the Birs. Part of the river flows directly along by the walls of the houses and forms a narrow alley through Moutier. You reach the end of the residential area across the Birs and briefly following the La Chali\u00e8re river. You then ascend on an attractive track at the eastern tip of the Moron. The ridge extends over a length of around 12 kilometres, going from east to west, and averages a width of 2 to 3 kilometres.",
            "You reach the broad ridge area through beech and fir forests. Drystone walls stretch in a dead straight line across the hills, and several mountain farms are to be found among the wide-ranging Jura pastures. By the time you reach the hamlet of Pr\u00e9s du Haut de la Charri\u00e8re, half the climb is done. A gravel road now takes you down a gentler incline to Moron Tower.",
            "The Ticino architect Mario Botta designed the 30-metre-high building. It was completed in 2004 with the help of around 700 apprentices. The construction was intended to promote the work of bricklayers and stonemasons. There is a spiral staircase with about 190 steps in the impressive tower, with each weighing 400 kg. You cover the final metres to the viewing platform on metal steps inside the tower. Once at the top, you enjoy a spectacular panorama of the Alps from S\u00e4ntis to Mont Blanc, and in the north from the Vosges to the Black Forest. The tower had to be closed temporarily (from summer 2023) when several of the steps broke off in 2022.",
            "You reach the highest point of the hike at 1,319 metres. Now a light gravel road running straight through the Jura pastures leads downhill again. Passing molehills, attractive trees and horse pastures, you reach the Pr\u00e8s de la Montagne farm. The trail turns here and heads north to Sornetan. Just 4 kilometres to the west is the former Abbey of Bellelay, where T\u00eate de Moine cheese was developed in the 12th century.",
            "The trail now runs through the hamlet of Montagne de Saules and then down to Sornetan on surfaced roads. The village is characterised by its well-maintained church, completed in 1709 and several traditional farms from the 18th and 19th centuries."

The area has been under protection since 1933 and the forest is left completely untouched.",

It was the private holiday retreat of Sir Ernest Cassel, a very wealthy German-British banker. Cassel frequently hosted illustrious guests, including Winston Churchill who later became the Prime Minister of Great Britain. The villa now houses the Pro Natura Visitor Centre Aletsch, a nature conservation centre with overnight accommodations.

The focal point of the tour is clearly Arosa \u2013 which grew from a Walser settlement into today\u2019s tourist destination, at the end of a valley that curves in a semi-circle down to Chur. It\u2019s particularly fascinating to discover Arosa from above, on the Parpaner Rothorn. On the descent you cross an almost moon-like landscape. Up above rust-red ferruginous cliffs dominate (Arosa has a history of ore mining), lower down, by the latest at the \u00c4lplisee lake, limestone grey mixes with green fields.",

After Alp Medergen and before the key point of the tour \u2013 a long metal stairway \u2013 views stretch down to Sap\u00fcn, the link between Schanfigg and Davos, once not only of major importance for trading cattle and other goods but also for the free movement of people between the two valley communities."

The area looks as if it had just snowed. As a result, locals also call this rare phenomenon \u201cNeige de Mai\u201d or May Snow. It draws large numbers of visitors to the shores of Lake Geneva every year. A nature trail on the subject of daffodils starts at Les Avants. The village with its air of Belle Epoque is one of Switzerland\u2019s oldest winter sports resorts. Along the path you'll find signs explaining what's around you. This way, hikers can better understand the geology, flora and fauna of the scenery they're passing through.",

From Sonloup, the route alternates between forests and meadows, and the views change constantly. One moment you're walking under the Dent de Jaman, next you're going across a meadow looking towards Les Pl\u00e9iades and then a meadow overlooking Les Avants, before reaching a summit from where you can see out over Caux and its palace. There's also a bench from where you can admire the Dents du Midi and Lake Geneva. Half-way through the loop you'll find the Cubly viewpoint, which takes in all these views to offer a 360\u00b0 panorama from the Jura to the Chablais, with Lake Geneva below. Of course, you will also pass several meadows covered with daffodils on this circular trail. Sometimes only a few of them are scattered across the fields. On other parcels of land, they grow more densely. ",
            "During the Belle Epoque, daffodils were a symbol of the Vaud Riviera, marking the end of every tourist season. Between 1897 and 1957, this was celebrated with a grandiose daffodil festival, which saw international orchestras performing and flower parades with decorated floats moving through the streets. The festival was one of the first major cultural events in Montreux. Well-heeled winter spa guests and day-trippers would take home boxes full of daffodils. Such a thing would be unthinkable today because there are fewer daffodil meadows. Compared to the 1960s, there has been a 70-80% decrease; as a result, wildflowers are protected."

Passando ex miniere d\u2019oro, si prosegue sul versante settentrionale verso la rocciosa gola di Gondo. ",
            "Attraverso il bosco sopra il Doveria e la strada si procede verso valle sovrastati da imponenti pareti rocciose. Il sentiero di lastre in pietra piatte e levigate si intreccia con grandi massi mentre nella gola di Gondo costeggia imponenti pareti rocciose verticali.",
            "Una parte del percorso, al riparo della strada coperta, conduce sotto diversi corsi d\u2019acqua che scendono in profondit\u00e0 a ridosso del sentiero. Un\u2019altra parte si svolge sulla mulattiera di Kaspar Stockalper o sulla strada napoleonica. I ponti e i contrafforti di questa meraviglia dell\u2019ingegneria stradale francese sono una costante di questa escursione. La strada nazionale \u00e8 la via di comunicazione pi\u00f9 recente, progettata a supporto di quelle esistenti. ",
            "La vecchia caserma napoleonica e il Fort Gondo \u2013 risalente alla prima guerra mondiale \u2013 testimoniano l\u2019importanza strategica della gola. La vecchia caserma \u00e8 collegata alla Via Stockalper da una passerella metallica che attraversa il Doveria e funge oggi da area di sosta per la strada nazionale. Il Fort Gondo comprende una galleria lunga 350 metri in cui prosegue l\u2019escursione.",
            "Alla fine della gola, in coincidenza con l\u2019uscita dalla Val Vaira, ecco apparire il villaggio di confine Gondo, dominato dalla Torre Stockalper. In questa localit\u00e0, la frana del 14 ottobre 2000 caus\u00f2 tredici vittime e distrusse numerosi edifici. Oggi la torre ospita un hotel per conferenze e una mostra sulle miniere d\u2019oro della valle. La Via Stockalper termina qui a Gondo ma il percorso prosegue con altre due tappe fino a Domodossola. The stage starts at the Hotel Post in the village of Simplon, which is located at 31 kilometres from both Brig and Domodossola. Thanks to its lovely stone houses, the village has a somewhat Mediterranean character. Those who want to learn more about the history of the region and the natural surroundings can delve into the past at the Ecomuseum with its wooden ceilings and massive walls.",
            "You leave the village through narrow alleys and follow the mule track and the gorge of the Chrummbach to start the gentle descent to Gondo in the east. Enormous wooded slopes rise up on all sides.",
            "After crossing extensive pastures, there\u2019s a steep descent through the forest along nice stone steps. At the bottom, the Chrummbach stream flows into the Doveria, and the old mule track descends on the other side of the crest into the romantic Zwischbergen valley to Gondo. Past former gold mines, the trail continues along the northern slope towards the rocky Gondo gorge.  ",
            "Through the forest above the Doveria stream and the road, you hike further down into the valley underneath impressive rock faces. A trail made of flat, smooth slabs of stone winds its way between huge boulders. In the Gondo gorge, vertical rock faces line the path.",
            "Protected by the covered road, part of the trail passes beneath various watercourses which drop into the depths beside the path. Some of the trail follows the mule track of Kaspar Stockalper or the Napoleon road. Time and again you come across bridges and masonry pillars of this masterpiece of French road construction. The national road is the latest traffic route, and it had to conquer its place next to the existing ones.",
            "Both the Napoleonic old barracks and the Gondo fort from the First World War are testimonies to the strategic importance of the gorge. The old barracks is linked to the Stockalperweg by a metal footbridge over the Doveria stream and today serves as a rest area for the national road. The Gondo fort includes a tunnel which is some 350 metres long and which the hike passes through.",
            "The border village of Gondo is situated at the end of the gorge and at the same time at the exit of the Zwischbergen valley. The village is dominated by the Stockalper tower. On 14 October 2000, a landslide claimed thirteen lives in Gondo and destroyed numerous buildings. Today, the tower is home to a seminar hotel and an exhibition about the valley\u2019s gold mines. Here, the Via Stockalper ends. However, the route continues on two more stages to Domodossola."

Before arriving in Jougne, where you turn around, you pass the Saint-Maurice chapel. It is located on a former pilgrimage route between the abbey of Saint-Maurice in Valais and Burgundy. From Jougne, you follow a railway line that once connected Vallorbe at the foot of Mont d'Or and Dent de Vaulion with Pontarlier. Opened in 1875, it was damaged during the Second World War and gradually closed down.

Modern-day visitors can admire the historic collection at the Centre International de M\u00e9canique d\u2019Art (CIMA) on guided tours.

But first comes the hard work: the first section of about two kilometres runs along a main road, making the view of Lake Neuch\u00e2tel even more beautiful. After about an hour, hikers reach one of the most significant preserved medieval road systems in Switzerland. The longest cart track of its time can still be found in the dense beech forest on the steep descent. Thanks to the channels carved into the Jura limestone, the muleteers were able to drive their salt-laden ox carts over the steep terrain until the 19th century. In 2014, the historic salt road was turned into an educational trail. Information boards tell the story of this important traffic artery between France and Switzerland dating back to the 13th century.",
            "After the steep descent on a narrow forest path, the route runs on mostly flat terrain through the sweeping agricultural land of the Jura plain. From the village of Vuiteboeuf with 500 inhabitants where waggoners once changed their horses, it skirts the forest at the foot of the \u201cRapilles de Baulmes\u201d cliff. The sound of chirping birds now replaces the engine noise heard on the historic section near the road. After just under an hour, the trail reaches the little village of Baulmes. It leaves the Jura chain behind, crossing huge arable fields and passing by cattle herds and farms. After almost an hour-and-a-half, it reaches Switzerland\u2019s oldest controlled wine-growing area: the C\u00f4tes de l\u2019Orbe. Between the wine villages of Rances and Valeyres-sous-Rances, the path winds its way through the vineyards and down the southern slope. The view from the church of Saint-Jacques (14/15th century) above Valeyres-sous-Rances sweeps across the gently rolling hills of the C\u00f4tes de l\u2019Orbe to Lake Geneva in the distance. An even older church, probably from the 10th century, can be found in Montcherand. The walls inside this Cluniac place of worship are adorned by the oldest figurative frescos in Switzerland.",

Crossing the Orbe Gorge (Gorges de l\u2019Orbe) over a small suspension bridge is an impressive experience. After hiking along the little river Orbe for just under an hour, we reach the small medieval town of the same name. Besides the old town, it\u2019s well worth visiting the palace square on a hill with its round tower built in 1233. The view from up here stretches across the Plaine de l\u2019Orbe to Mont Blanc."

Its name stems from the whitish colour that comes from the inflow of the Cambrena glacier. Both, the linguistic boundary between the Romansh-speaking Engadine and the Italian Valposchiavo, as well as the watershed are located at the height of the dam. From Lej Nair the water flows into the Black Sea, from Lago Bianco it makes its way to the Adriatic Sea. ",

It is characterised by narrow streets and houses that stand close together and are partly connected by archways. The most important building in Aigle is the castle, which you pass shortly after the start of the stage at the train station.

At the Gryonne river, you are almost halfway through the hike and you have covered most of the altitude difference.",

Now comes the final hour of the hike to the end of this stage in St. Maurice. Pilgrims walking all the way from Canterbury to Rome are now right in the middle of the route. Shortly before St. Maurice you pass the fairy grotto. The water has worn away the rock here for thousands of years, creating a grotto with a small underground lake and waterfall."

St. Idda, who was related to the Habsburgs, lived there in the mid-12th century. After the death of her husband, Diethelm IV of Toggenburg, Idda retreated to Au (part of Fischingen) and chose to live as a hermit. Later she entered Fischingen Abbey and became a nun.

The climate in the plain increased the risk of malaria. Plus, Bellinzona was an embattled town back then and the valley was located in a strategic position for passing armies and soldiers. The elaborately restored village contains typical stone houses, vegetable gardens, terrace-like grain fields and vineyards. Dry stone walls and an old mule track were also renovated.

The 47 km long river originates at Kanderfirn and later flows through Lake Thun and into the Aare River. The name Kander comes from the Celtic word \u201ckando\u201d and means \u201cwhite\u201d or \u201cshining\u201d, a reference to the light cloudiness caused by the glacier\u2019s meltwater. The route follows the course of the river and soon ends at today\u2019s destination, the Kandersteg railway station."

Below the Oberbauen mountainside you continue uphill, past the beautiful Ful Platten waterfall in the direction of Faulberg. The Rigi, queen of the mountains, Pilatus and parts of fjord-like Lake Lucerne with the Mittelland region behind are an incredible visual experience. ",

Celebrate the end of this tour with something tasty to eat at the local mountain restaurant while enjoying the views of Lake Lucerne. A cable car takes the hikers to Emmetten, about 800 m further down. The village is beautifully situated on a mountain terrace between Beckenried and Seelisberg above the lake\u2019s southern shore."

            "The area of the rock slide is still impressive, with masses of debris and boulders and unusual vegetation now reclaiming the area. The Wildspitz, the highest mountain in Canton Zug, offers superb views of the lakes of Central Switzerland.",
            "The hike begins at Arth-Goldau station, a vital railway junction on the Gotthard line. The twin locality lies between Lake Zug and Lake Lauerz in the canton of Schwyz. A massive landslide formed an alluvial fan some 200 years ago. Today, this rocky, pristine, natural landscape is home to the renowned Goldau Wildlife Park. ",
            "You quickly leave the settlement area by heading north through the village centre along the main road. A steep ascent leads across flower meadows and past numerous cherry trees. In spring, the blooming hillsides provide a spectacular nature experience. ",
            "The trail turns into a forest path that leads steeply up to the Gnipen, following the ridge. The narrow path between forest and pastures offers breathtaking views, sometimes on both sides. Once you reach the summit, it becomes clear that you have been hiking next to the Goldau rockslide area. ",
            "Two hundred years ago, a massive forty million cubic metres of rock detached from the Gnipen and tumbled into the valley. Three villages were destroyed, and 457 people lost their lives. The natural disaster made headlines throughout Europe.",
            "A well-made, solid path continues along the ridge through the Bannwald forest up to the Wildspitz, the highest mountain in the canton of Zug and the stage's highest point, 1,570 metres above sea level. When the weather is clear, you can marvel at the S\u00e4ntis and the Churfirsten peaks from here. ",
            "On a narrower path, you now head downhill through cow pastures and small wooded areas. The Halsegg alpine inn invites you to take a last break before the descent to Sattel. The village with Europe's oldest wooden house, dating from 1176, is located between Lake Lauerz and Lake Aegeri and was the scene of the Battle of Morgarten. ",
            "The route ends between the campsite and the valley station of the world's first revolving aerial gondola. The gondolas, slowly rotating around their axis, take you straight to the Mostelberg. A toboggan run, a 374-metre suspension bridge and a tyre slide await at the top."

            "Impressive hike through the Gasteretal, one of the most magnificent high-Alpine valleys. Surrounded by steep cliffs, the waters of the young Kander flow sometimes gently, sometimes untamed and thundering. Wealth of Alpine flora in spring.",
            "The quiet resort of Kandersteg with a population of about 1000 is located at the foot of the L\u00f6tschen Pass. Sometimes directly along the Kander River, then at some distance from the water, the path meanders up to Eggeschwand. Near the Sunnb\u00fchl base station it dips into the Chluse ravine and then becomes steeper. The thundering of the Kander accompanies you on the climb up through the ravine. In the second half of the 19th century the road construction work opening up the Gasteretal began here and repairs were made at a later time. The section where the pass road was blasted out of the Chluse is particularly spectacular. Masonry parapets, drystone walling, edged stones, arched bridges, tunnels, a semi-gallery \u2013 all these structural masterpieces can still be seen today. Therefore, despite the motorised traffic, the experience is far more exciting on the original road than on the relatively unspectacular mule track. ",
            "The Chluse is followed by the floodplain of Gastereholz, surrounded by steep cliffs. The Schwarzbach and Geltibach rivers merge with the young Kander here. The latter dominates the high valley and meanders through the landscape joined by many tributaries. The path also continues to snake uphill through beautiful birch forests. The solitude and the gorgeous flowers growing in the Gasteretal are fascinating, especially in the spring. Even rarities, such as clematis or lady\u2019s slippers can be spotted here. While approaching the frequently snow-covered Sackhorn, it is well worth your while to take a look at the mountains behind you, Bunderchrinde Pass, for example, next to Chline Loner. The pass connects Kandersteg with Adelboden. ",
            "After the last bridge near Geissalmi the path zigzags to the paved road that later ends in the small settlement of Selden. This is the starting point of the highlight of this tour: the crossing of the L\u00f6tschen Pass. As the oldest mountain passage between the Valais and Bern it is very popular with hikers. The L\u00f6tschen Pass lost its importance as a mule trail when the easier Gemmi route was developed."

In addition to wind turbines and photovoltaic systems, there is also an observatory on the mountain. With its planetarium measuring 4.5 metres in diameter, it is a popular destination for excursions. Here you can discover the secrets of the universe.",
            "Now follows the descent of just over 500 metres in altitude to St. Imier, the destination of the stage. The town's economic boom was the result of the watchmaking industry in the 19th century. Large factories and a watchmaking school were built at that time. However, the watch crisis of the 1970s made it necessary to reorient the town. Today, energy technology and micromechanics also play important roles. The Mus\u00e9e Longines in St. Imier illustrates the history of watchmaking from 1832 to the present day with watches, chronographs, navigation instruments and tools."

            "Bellinzona is probably Switzerland's most Italian city. Three massive medieval castles dominate the townscape and tell the story of an embattled city. This is because of the city's strategic location in a narrow valley on the way to the Alpine passes of Gotthard, San Bernardino and Lukmanier. Today, modern life flourishes in what is culturally a well-preserved Lombardy town. ",
            "From the Bellinzona railway station, the route leads down to the Ticino. Following the leafy river banks, you reach Giubiasco. On the outskirts of town lies the wooded Motto Grande Park with a large playground and biotope. After that, the populated area changes into a secluded, natural environment.",
            "A delightful trail leads steeply uphill through the forest to Cima di Dentro at an altitude of 1,000 metres. From here, a path paved in places with natural stones leads through pristine birch forests and between rocks down to Isone, where the Swiss army trains grenadiers and parachute reconnaissance forces.",
            "After leaving the village, the route leads uphill again. Small bridges cross over several streams. Until Muricce, the trail is steep in parts and then climbs steadily up to Gola di Lago. Here, the two national routes of the Trans Swiss Trail and the Via Gottardo separate for a short while. Along with Brolla, Indemini, Mezzovico and Gandria, the pass formed a defensive line during the Second World War. ",
            "After about six hours of hiking, there's one last descent of just over an hour. In parts, a stream and dry stone walls line the beautiful trail. After Odogno, the trail crosses a road, and soon you are in Tesserete, the destination of this long stage. Visible from afar is the imposing parish church of Santo Stefano with its Romanesque bell tower. Towards the east, there are beautiful views of the Denti della Vecchia, a mountain range reminiscent of the rock formation in the Dolomites."

On a clear day, you can enjoy a fantastic panoramic view: from the Simmental over the Saanenland to the mountain gems of Fribourg. The \"St\u00fcbleni\" (small rooms) refer to the individual \"craters\" in the Gryden area, whereby \"Gryde\" probably comes from Chride (chalk). But how did this unique area in Switzerland, which fascinates geologists, biologists and hikers alike, come into being? The rain gradually dissolves the almost white, relatively soft gypsum rock. The water carves holes in it, but continues to flow underground, creating a system of gypsum karst with cavities. When one of these collapses, the sinkholes become visible on the surface. In the St\u00fcbleni area, these seepage funnels are particularly numerous. ",

A detour to the refuge is worthwhile here: take a break and enjoy the moon-like crater landscape before heading back. Those who do this additional loop should be sure-footed and free from vertigo. This time you pass the \"St\u00fcbleni\" to the north. From there, the trail descends steadily to Steinstoss, after which there is only about one kilometre left to reach the starting point."

Meanwhile, the French under Molitor held N\u00e4fels and Mollis. While Suvorov was still holding the council of war in Glarus, Auffenberg moved on 2 October towards the Sernftal valley and onward to the Panixer Pass. Silently, taking prisoners with them, the Russians cleared the positions near Glarus and Netstal during the night of 5 October and moved towards the Sernftal.",

Thanks to the resistance of Russian general Bagration, however, the train was able to make its way unimpeded into the valley. An army of over 15,000 men marched up the bumpy mule track to Elm, with only shreds of their uniforms clinging to their emaciated bodies. Not even the officers had intact footwear, and much of the army went barefoot. ",

            "S\u00f6renberg is located in the UNESCO Entlebuch Biosphere. Nowhere else in Switzerland can you find so many nationally protected moors in such a small area as here. On the approximately 400 square kilometres, you can immerse yourself in a mystical world: In addition to pristine moor landscapes, idyllic alpine meadows, small mountain lakes, karst formations, primeval mountain pines and deep ditches and gorges dating back to the Ice Age captivate the visitors. The hiking trail leads uphill away from the Lucerne resort of S\u00f6renberg. The view of the Brienzer Rothorn and the Schrattenfluh, one of the largest contiguous karst fields in Switzerland, is superb. The approximately 6 km long mountain range is clearly distinguishable from the lovely Emmental and the Napf area. The mostly vegetation-free cirques (channels) of the Schratten limestone have numerous, widely branching caves. The water seeps directly into the depths through the fissured surface.",

The view is now complemented by the lake of Sarnen and the summit of the Titlis. Continuing uphill, after another hour you reach the highest point of the stage below the Alpoglerberg at approx. 1640 m.a.s.l. ",
            "Next follows the descent. The path dips into the forest, partly with a lovely view, as you leave Sandboden and the P\u00f6rter forest behind you. You continue to follow the Altibach stream until it joins the Laui river. From here it is not far to Giswil, where the hike ends after almost six hours. The village is located in the valley area of the lake of Sarnen, at the foot of the Br\u00fcnig and Glaubenbielen passes.

            "Zwingen was originally a farming community, but later developed into an industrial town. Many buildings are now under landmark protection, a memory of times gone by. The hiking trail begins at the railway station and passes Zwingen Castle shortly thereafter. First mentioned in official records in 1312, it is situated on two rock shelves and was completely surrounded by water. The actual castle stands on the main island: the palace with the residential building and the roofed castle keep. The round tower is the oldest part of the castle. After crossing the Birs River and passing a residential neighbourhood, you follow a gravel road through the forest and across pastures. In the village of Blauen, Via Surprise and Via Jura split and go in separate directions. By now you have been hiking for about an hour. ",
            "Continue past the church and leave Blauen village behind. The route continues along a lovely tree-lined road to Blauenweide, a nature protection area with old tree populations. After the forest you pass Bergmattenhof and then the road turns into a somewhat steeper path. The highest point is reached at M\u00e4tzerlechr\u00fcz. Path and forest road keep alternating on the way down to the junction between stages 5 and 6. While the last stage of Via Surprise turns to the right heading toward Dornach, the route described here continues to Mariastein. In the spring, you can smell the wild garlic that grows on the side of the road. ",

It is the second-most important place of pilgrimage in Switzerland behind Einsiedeln Abbey. The Maria im Stein chapel of grace, which is located in a cave 59 steps below the church, was built in the 15th century. Since then it has attracted countless pilgrims who come here to worship the smiling Madonna."

A visit to the Observatory and the Astronomy House is another  enjoyable and cultural aspect to discover. Back to hiking, a climb through the meadows will take you to the forest hut Pre Godat. Then you can walk in the forest itself. If you wish, you can make a small detour to visit the famous taxidermist. If you plan to visit the taxidermist up until the  summer of 2010, we advise you to book (more than 3,000 animals are exhibited). After the summer of 2010, a new exhibition building will be opened. Back on the road, you'll enjoy the picturesque road Tiergarten Gorges, which runs along the river. The itinerary continues uphill leaving the forest. Afterwards you descend and see a farm. Then you take a path through the fields to reach the village of Vermes.",
            "In Vermes, a visit of the church is very worthwhile to admire its historic frescoes from the fifteenth century, (registered by UNESCO). Behind the church, you'll find the educational botanical trail. Further up, you will arrive at the pasture Plain-Fayen where there is another forest hut. You can have a nice break there or at the picnic's place in the shade of the beautiful pines. After a short rest, you go down through the forest until you reach  the village of Corban. The forest huts are open to all for picnic and to use the grill. Several restaurants are located along the trail: Vicques, Vermes, Corban.

            "In autumn 1799, Russian General Suvorov and his army crossed through the Swiss Alps in order to oust the French from the country. The ViaSuworow follows the route of this campaign through breathtaking mountain landscape.",
            "Coming from Italy, the Russians crossed the Ticino border at Ponte Tresa, marched over the Monte Ceneri, through the Leventina valley and over the Gotthard, to push forward to Ursern and through the Reusstal valley as far as Altdorf. Resistance by the French at the Urnersee lake and in the Glarner lowlands forced Suvorov to evade them by marching over the Chinzig Chulm and Pragel passes and finally to retreat through the Sernftal valley and over the Panixer pass into the Surselva. The Russian troops left the region of the former Three Leagues alliance via the Rheintal valley in the direction of Russia.",
            "The Suvorov memorials on the Gotthard and in the Sch\u00f6llenen gorge are reminders of these dramatic events, as are the general's quarters in listed buildings such as the Muotathal Monastery and the Suvorov House in Elm.",
            "In addition to the historic sites along the route, the natural setting is also exceptionally impressive. Rugged mountain valleys, scenic passes, mountain lakes and rivers can all be enjoyed without any worries - in contrast to Suvorov\u2019s troops, who had to march the route under time pressure, enemy attacks and the onset of winter.",

The hiking trail follows the Emme for the first few minutes, then leaves the course of the river at Untere Brach. Climbing uphill on paths and a paved road, you reach Ober Steinboden after an ascent of 400 metres, followed by Hinder R\u00e4misgumme. The small farm is situated on the border of the Unesco Biosphere Entlebuch. The \"Wild West of Lucerne\" is known for its alpine pastures, untouched moorland, the wildly rugged Schrattenfluh or the Brienzer Rothorn, which is probably one of the most beautiful vantage points in Switzerland. ",
            "The Schrattenfluh, a mountain range of about six kilometres, is now located directly in front of you. On the other side you can see the extensive, mostly vegetation-free karst fields of the Schratten limestone. The numerous caves and furrows are the result of erosion processes, since the rain immediately seeps into the subsoil through the porous rock ledges. A short time later, you reach Pfyffer at 1316 m.a. s. l. From here and up to Wachthubel, the Napfbergland border trail uses the same route as the Trans Swiss Trail. Now the Hohgant, also known as the crown of the Emmental, emerges into view. After a gentle up and down hike, the highest point of the stage is reached an hour later at 1414 m.a. s. l.. The Wachthubel with its breathtaking panoramic view invites you to take a longer break. ",
            "Now follows the approximately one-hour descent to Schangnau, the destination of the hike. The village is located at the top of the Emmental on the border to the Bernese Oberland, surrounded by striking mountain ranges. The population is still widely involved in agriculture and dairy farming. The water buffalo are a speciality here. Their milk is very rich, containing about twice as much protein and fat as cow's milk, whereas the cholesterol content of buffalo meat is half that of beef. Both are consumed here without long transport routes."

If you want, you can shorten the hike here. That would be a pity, of course. If you are lucky, you will meet some cuddly black-nosed sheep typical in Valais, grazing leisurely on the meadows along the slightly ascending path. It takes only a few minutes to the Lengsee. The path is relatively even, and in no time you arrive at the turnoff towards the Honeggerhorn. This is the highest point of the tour. A detour down to the Brusee is worthwhile: above the ridge, a magnificent view opens up in the direction of Obergoms. Afterwards, the rest of the tour is entirely downhill. ",

            "Established 2000 years ago, in medieval times the ViaFrancigena became the most important pilgrims\u2019 path in Europe. In Switzerland it leads through beautiful Jura and Alpine landscapes, the stage on the Grossen St. Bernhard being particularly magnificent.",
            "In 990, Sigerich, Archbishop of Canterbury, returned to England from Rome and documented the stages on his journey, a route known even to the Romans. His itinerary is now considered the oldest description of the ViaFrancigena through Europe. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Frankenstrasse remained one of the major arterial roads, used by traders, soldiers and crowned heads of state. Since 1300, it has been regarded as the most important pilgrims\u2019 path in Europe, crossing Switzerland via the Jura and Alps.",
            "The Swiss stage runs through a variety of landscapes and is without doubt also one of the most spectacular pilgrims\u2019 paths in Europe. The route from Sainte-Croix to Vuiteboeuf leads past unique sections of cart tracks then alongside the quiet Venoge to Lac L\u00e9man. Stops at Romainm\u00f4tier Abbey and the Roman mosaics in Orbe are highly recommended.",
            "From Lausanne, the ViaFrancigena runs through the vineyards of Lavaux to the bend in the Rhone. From the ancient city of Octodurus, it winds through the narrow pass shaped by the wild waters of the Drance to the northern slopes of the Grossen Sankt Bernhard-Pass. In Val d\u2019Entremont, medieval villages line the route, which peaks in the aptly-named Combe des Morts."

This hunting area is easily surveyed from the hiking trail. Also along the route and hidden under the enormous karst area, is the H\u00f6llloch, the longest cave system in Europe with 195 km of explored passageways.",

The unkempt alps on tiny terraces are evidence of the tough struggle for survival that ruled here a century ago.

Here, the magnificent all-round view invites you to take a break.",

And hiking in the Jura is often the subject of discussion. Granted: the Jura lacks heady heights, but this hiking destination can be headed for early in the year and well into autumn. It offers surprisingly colourful meadows, lush green woodland, dark gorges and rugged rock basins. Picturesque little towns nestle between high scenic ridges and wide high plains. Ancient monasteries and churches lie on the path and there\u2019s no shortage of culinary delights.",

Spicy T\u00eate de Moine cheese is made in the Freiberge dairies, the show dairy at Bellelay Monastery gives a look behind the scenes. On Mont Crosin and Mont Soleil, one of the most important centres for renewable energy and at the end of the route, fascinating Swiss perfection: on the track of time, you hike to La Chaux-de-Fonds and the International Watch Museum."

Then a path leads downhill to Wang and later to Ried, a small populated outpost of today\u2019s destination. Bellwald is located on the right side of the Rhone valley. It is the highest village in the Goms region and cars are banned there. A visit to its church and the quaint village centre with its narrow lanes and the typical sunburned houses and barns should not be missed."

            "The hike starts in Les Prixes and first leads downhill through the forest. It then follows an undulating trail before the forest gets lighter and the route crosses the Manna River, situated near the authentic hamlet of Ossona. This is a showcase project for gentle and sustainable agritourism. It didn\u2019t always look as charming as it does now. The last families and their cattle began to drift away permanently in the 1960s. The Alpine huts were left to fall apart and nature reclaimed its terrain. All this changed in 2005: The municipality of Saint-Martin decided to invest in an agritourism centre with financial support from the federal and the cantonal government. Disintegrated stables were renovated or rebuilt as inns. Today, Ossona has a cheese cellar, a solar system, and dairy cows and goats are grazing on the pastures. The restaurant serves local products. It also offers overnight accommodations and anybody interested is welcome to help with the work.",
            "After the peaceful hamlet, life gets exciting. Below Saint-Martin the route crosses a 133 m pedestrian suspension bridge spanning a steep 30 m drop. From the famous Passerelle de la Grande Combe the view of the pyramids of Euseigne is extraordinary. The bizarre rock formations are up to 15 m high and under nature conservation protection. They are considered to be among the most significant geological sites in the Alps. ",
            "Shortly before the destination the hikers reach the Borgne River. It first flows through a high valley, then through the deep canyons of the Val d\u2019H\u00e9rens until it finally joins the Rhone near Sion. Across a bridge and briefly uphill the trail leads to the village of La Luette, where it comes to its end."

            "The second stage of the Seeland-Solothurn Trail starts at Biel/Bienne railway station and immediately passes Nidau Castle. The castle was a massive water fortress until late in the 19th century. After the Jura water correction, the water level dropped by around two metres.",

The river's path at the time led to devastating floods, as the water could spread almost unhindered over the flat terrain of the Seeland.",

It consists of numerous pastures which are bordered by hedges and rows of trees and accessed by a dense network of paths.

This route is a somewhat more peaceful and sunny way to discover the popular mountain. The ascent between the start of the trail and Capanna Tamaro is only shaded in late morning. The gondola takes the hikers from Rivera to Alpe Foppa in just a few minutes. A visit to the church Santa Maria degli Angeli, a modern concrete structure perched on a rocky outcrop, is almost mandatory.

After catching our breath, the route continues up to the well-known destination, Monte Tamaro. In good weather the views from the top range all the way to the Monte Rosa massif and the Matterhorn.

The path then branches off, down to Alpe Duragno (open to the public) with grazing cows, sheep and goats. The trail returning to Alpe Foppa follows the mountain and is pleasant to walk because it is not very steep and offers a nice view of the plane. At the destination there is a tough choice to make: a break in the mountain restaurant, a visit to the children\u2019s playground, or perhaps an adrenaline rush on the summer sledding run, the zip line or in the adventure rope park."

            "Leaving the tree line behind, you will reach a small alluvial plain of the Leitibach below Sch\u00f6nb\u00fchl. A fantastic view of the mountain chain opens up here, including Dolden-, Fr\u00fcnden-, Oeschinen- and Bl\u00fcmlisalphorn, all above 3300 m, and all the way to the Kanderfirn glacier. Continue uphill, across the pasture, and you soon get to Balme at the end of the L\u00f6tsche glacier. The hiking time up to this point takes at least 2.5 hours. You then traverse the end of the glacier across a scree slope and approach the glacier. The last steep section follows a short while later: a narrow path up the cliff, secured in part by steel cables. After about 15 minutes, you reach an altitude of 2689 m and there you are, on top of the L\u00f6tschen Pass. ",
            "The view of the prominent Bietschorn is spectacular. The descent takes you through an area of glacial polishing, interspersed with small lakes. In the distance, you will recognize the mountain chain with the Dom and the peaks of Weisshorn, Zinalrothorn and Matterhorn. It takes about 1.5 hours to get down to Lauchernalp, which is today\u2019s destination. The resort is situated on a sunny plateau above Wiler in the L\u00f6tschental and can be reached by gondola."

            "Walser people settled early in Partnun, below the Schijenflue, as they did in Gafiatal. Today an alp area with typical timber houses in the middle of the R\u00e4tikonmassiv - an outdoor eldorado. Schweizertor: Alpine crossing to Brand (A), where the first Walsers settled in the 14th century.",
            "The Walser Trail follows the tracks of the Walser people in the high valleys of Graub\u00fcnden in 19 one-day stages, running along historical, pristine hiking trails. The approximately ten-hour hike begins in the Walser settlement of St. Ant\u00f6nien. It's the last stage of the long-distance hiking trail covering around 300 kilometres and 40,000 vertical metres.",
            "Past the pretty, late-Gothic church in St. Ant\u00f6nien, the trail leads slightly uphill on asphalt through the lush green hilly landscape. Partnun was settled by Walsers as early as the 14th century and inhabited all year round. Following the Schanielabach stream, you can see scattered huts and houses on the slopes to the left and to the right, the typical Walser settlements. After Partnun, the route continues up the valley on a narrow path. By the crystal-clear Partnunsee lake, large erratics invite you to do some climbing. The small lake is nestled between the limestone rock faces of the Sulzfluh and the Schijenflue. ",
            "At the foot of the imposing Sulzfluh, the trail continues uphill to the Carschina Hut, 2,236 metres above sea level. The views from the southern slope over the Pr\u00e4ttigau's peaks are breathtaking. Climbers, hikers and bikers meet at the hut, which has around 85 beds. Those who stay overnight can see the limestone cliffs of the R\u00e4tikon in a silvery light when the weather is clear and the moon shines. ",
            "Via a narrow path between steeply sloping meadows and scree, the route leads past the three towers of the Drusenfluh. To the south, they form vertical, up to 600-metre-high walls. At Chilchi, the Walserweg branches off to the right and separates from the Pr\u00e4ttigauer H\u00f6henweg (high-level trail). From here on to the Austrian border, concentration is required. Exposed, over an iron staircase, partly steep and secured with ropes \u2013 the path winds its way up to the Schweizertor. Massive rock formations rise vertically nearby. It's hard to imagine that there was once a customs hut here that was occupied all year round and can still be seen today. ",
            "Once in the Austrian Montafon, you hike on narrow footpaths through alpine meadows at the foot of the Kirchlispitzen. Via the Verajoch, you reach the end of the Brandnertal valley, where L\u00fcnersee lake lies. With an area of about 112 hectares, it was once the largest natural mountain lake in the Eastern Alps and is now one of the major reservoirs in Western Austria. It is suitable for fishing, and a walk around it affords fantastic views of the glaciers of the Brandner Valley. The lake, shimmering in brilliant turquoise in the sunshine, was voted Austria's most beautiful place in 2019.",
            "A long, narrow dam leads to the Douglas Hut, where you can spend the night. The hike to this point takes about seven and a half hours. It's not for nothing that the descent that now follows is called \"B\u00f6ser Tritt\" (wicked step). You can skip 400 metres in altitude difference by taking the cable car. The path has been cut into the rock, fixed with iron steps and secured with ropes. Along the Alvier, the route continues down the Seetal valley to the tree line. A beautiful forest path leads through coniferous woods. ",
            "The hike leads past the Kesselfall. Roaring and foaming, the Alvier flows through a narrow, 40-metre-deep rock gorge. The Kesselfall is easily accessible via footbridges, and a forest road continues to Brand. The long route ends in the tiny village with its pretty church, located in the valley basin at 1,050 metres above sea level."

            "The historic stage to Airolo starts on the most important north-south trans-Alpine route, the language border between German- and Italian-speaking Switzerland and the wellspring of Europe. Even the Romans avoided the Gotthard route, not for the Alps' height, but for the Sch\u00f6llenen Gorge between Andermatt and G\u00f6schenen, which was reputed to be impassable. It all changed with the construction of the Devil's Bridge at the start of the 13th century. At the same time, the muleteer's trail was also improved over its entire length. The pass soon became one of the most important Alpine crossings.",
            "From the start, the route first follows the winding Tremola road for 100 metres. It's Switzerland's longest memorial to road construction. Hiking on a path, you will soon find yourself high above the world-famous serpentine road, which on its most spectacular section climbs 300 metres in altitude around 24 bends. To this day, the Tremola road has largely retained the appearance of its reconstruction completed in 1951 \u2013 with granite cobblestones, old drystone walls and the beautiful kilometre stones. ",

Airolo, at 1,175 metres above sea level, is known for the southern portal of the railway and motorway tunnels. The countryside surrounding the uppermost village in the Leventina valley also boasts scenic beauty and historic sites: unspoilt villages, an exhibition dairy, idyllic mountain lakes and hiking areas.

When you reach the Alp Caschl\u00e9, you'll find a flat rock in the middle of a meadow: that is the legendary Hexenplatte (witch's stone), called the Platta dil Barlot in Rhaeto-Romansch. According to the legend, the stone was carried to Caschl\u00e9 on a spider's thread from the Alp Culmatsch, on the other side of the Val Milar. Witches are supposed to have danced on it. No-one should resist the temptation to try a little dance on it themselves. It's fun, and it loosens up your limbs for the rest of the walk.",

            "Einsiedeln is situated in the heart of central Switzerland in a pre-alpine high valley landscape. The route starts at the train station, but does not pass the famous monastery. Therefore, a detour to the impressive cathedral of Switzerland's most important pilgrimage site is definitely worthwhile.",
            "A first short passage leads from the station through a residential neighbourhood and past the hospital. Then, on the right-hand side, the huge ski jumping ramps catch your eye. The facility comprises 4 jumps, including the longest jump in Switzerland with a hill size of 117 metres. If you are lucky, you can watch international professional athletes during training.",
            "You then continue uphill over the Chatzenstrick and descend to Altmatt. Even from the heights of the Chatzenstrick you can see that the valley below is quite special. In autumn, the moor shimmers in brownish-red to golden colours. In the cool, humid climate of the plateau between Biberbrugg and Rothenthurm, high moors and shallow bogs have developed over thousands of years. When it rains, the peat mosses soak up the water like a sponge, and once the sun is back, they release the stored water into the environment. In this way, peatlands act as a natural flood protection. Since dead plant remains do not decompose due to the wet conditions, the carbon they contain is stored as peat for thousands of years and thus binds CO2.",
            "After passing the moor, there is a slight ascent up to the Raten. The splendid view over the Aegeri lake and the alps invites you to take a rest after almost three hours. The 7.2 square kilometre lake was originally formed by a glacier. The Battle of Morgarten between the Confederates and the Habsburgs took place on its shores in 1315. A lovely path through the forest leads to the Mangelh\u00f6he, a gravel road then descends to Unter\u00e4geri. This is where the five-and-a-half-hour hike ends."

            "Splendid hike across the sunny slopes of the Val d'Entremont. The trail leads through well-preserved villages with traditional architecture and historical charm, accompanied by a wonderful view of the valley and the Mont Blanc massif.",
            "From the Val d'Entremont, a road leads over the Great St. Bernard pass into the Italian Aosta valley. The pass has been an important transit route for centuries. But the Valais valley is also home to a number of very well preserved historic villages and hamlets. This hike connects the most beautiful among them: Liddes, Chandonne, Commeire, La Rosi\u00e8re, Chamoille d'Orsi\u00e8res and La Douay. The oldest and most famous route through the valley is the Via Francigena, a historic pilgrimage route from Canterbury to Rome. This hike, on the other hand, takes you a little higher through sunny pastures, forests and sleepy mountain villages off the beaten track. ",
            "The starting point is Liddes with its 13th century church and an interesting little museum. Afterwards, you reach Chardonne, a peaceful hamlet at 1454 m altitude situated on a sunny terrace. All the villages along the route boast a rich architectural heritage in the form of traditional houses, chalets and barns. A prime example: the sustainable tourism project \"montagne alternative\" in Commeire, a so-called \"albergo diffuso\". Every fourth barn in the hamlet is part of the concept hotel. From the outside, you can\u2019t tell them apart from the rest of the barns and dwellings. The hamlet hides another, not immediately obvious surprise: an underground artillery fortification. Built in the early 1940s, it had room for almost 140 soldiers who would defend the valley. The complex can be visited and it is even possible to rent parts of it for events. ",
            "The next village, La Rosi\u00e8re, attracts pilgrims from all over the world: Maurice Tornay, a Catholic priest (1910-1949) grew up here. He was active in missions in China and Tibet and was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1993. His birthplace is open to the public. After the sleepy village of Chamoille, the route ends at the bottom of the valley in La Douay."

Since the Gotthard Railway opening in 1882, it has been a landmark on the train ride south, during which you get to see the little Baroque church from three different angles. The stone and wood-built houses, along with the splendid fountain dominating the village square, are also a sight to behold. After two short sections along the motorway, the route leaves the road for good and continues slightly above the Reuss river. At Fusterblacken, you are directly above the motorway. A little further on, the path turns into a gravel road. The route continues along the railway line to G\u00f6schenen.",

The village was bustling between 1872 and 1882 and again almost a hundred years later, from 1970 to 1980. At the time, the world's longest railway tunnel and later the longest road tunnel were built. For this purpose, thousands of guest workers come to the village. Stretching to the west of G\u00f6schenen, away from the flow of traffic, lies the G\u00f6scheneralptal valley, a breathtakingly beautiful recreational area boasting reservoirs, moors, ponds and the 3,630-metre-high Dammastock.

            "The route now leads through the Sch\u00f6llenenschlucht (gorge) and, shortly after, across the beautiful, three-arch H\u00e4derlisbr\u00fccke (stone bridge). Your hike continues directly above the road, with the Reuss roaring ever more wildly through the valley. After the last bends, you can already see the monument to General Suvorov, who in 1799 successfully led Russian troops through the Sch\u00f6llenenschlucht despite resistance by the French. The famous Teufelsbr\u00fccke (Devil's Bridge) follows immediately after that. Around the year 1200, the people of Ursern \u2013 who knows, maybe even with help from the devil \u2013 achieved the unique feat of building a bridge across the gorge, which was previously considered impassable. In 1595, the wooden bridge was replaced by a stone structure. Note: The short 15-minute detour passing through the military shaft and above the Teufelsbr\u00fccke is worthwhile. The stage ends in Andermatt at the foot of the Oberalp Pass."

            "German and French-speaking Switzerland meet at the Bielersee lake and the landscape also offers contrasts. On the southern shore, fens and secluded reed beds, on the northern shore, vineyards and the Jura chain with the often cloud-covered Chasseral. The Seeland-Solothurn-Weg begins in the small town of Erlach and over four days leads along not only the reed beds of the Bielersee southern shore, but also along banks of the Aare and Emme rivers. The changing atmosphere of lake and river are characteristic of the route.",
            "It\u2019s worth strolling to the castle in Erlach and through the narrow lanes of the old town quarter, or even making a detour to the St. Petersinsel, where writer Jean-Jacques Rousseau found refuge. With wonderful views of the opposite villages, the trail leads along the shore via L\u00fcscherz to Nidau and the bilingual town of Biel. The varied and attractive trail first stays close to the water, following the Nidau-B\u00fcren canal, marvel at the old course of the Aare and the striking wooden bridge at B\u00fcren. The observation tower in the H\u00e4ftli nature reserve at the gates of the medieval town will provide kids and adults with plenty of excitement.",

You hike on the right and left bank of the Emme to where it flows into the Aare before reaching the history-laden baroque town of Solothurn at the end of the route."

            "Fl\u00fcelen is located on the shore of Lake Uri under the steep forested hillside of the Eggberge. The former church is now used in a variety of ways and houses a rock crystal exhibition. Rudenz Castle, with its castle park that is open to the public, also invites you to linger.

The cantons gifted the Swiss Path to the population of Switzerland in 1991. The cantons of Schaffhausen, the two Appenzells and St. Gallen were allowed to design this section of the trail in the order in which they joined the Swiss Confederation.",
            "A wooden bench shaped like a deck chair invites you to relax. Screeching seagulls, honking ships and the warm Foehn wind ensure a holiday mood. The train sounds remind you of the presence of the important north-south axis from Zurich to Milan, which runs parallel to long stretches of the route.",
            "On the lake promenade, you can walk comfortably along the hillside between the tracks and water. A narrow wooden footbridge goes underneath the Sulzegg viaduct. You are fast approaching the spectacular section on the rock faces of the Axenflue. The path was built into and through the rock and it provides a vertical view downwards from the old Axenstrasse onto the rock face to the azure blue Lake Uri and the surrounding mountains.",

Huge rock arches and pillars support the mountain under which the hikers pass, and they give you an idea of the effort involved in building the old Axenstrasse. Before this was opened in 1865, the important north-south traffic between Brunnen and Fl\u00fcelen had to be loaded onto ships.",

During the day, one of around twenty melodies is played for the first few minutes of every hour. Further down on the lake shore, Wilhelm Tell is said to have escaped by jumping out of the bailiff Gessler's boat to the Tellsplatte to save himself. Four frescoes in the chapel depict the R\u00fctli oath, the shooting of the apple, Tell\u2019s leap and Gessler\u2019s death in the Hohle Gasse.",
            "A stunning trail follows the shore past the Tellsplatte. Beneath gnarled pine trees and past steep cliffs, you pass by several attractive places rest. Sometimes the trail is right next to the water, with small waves engulfing the large boulders beneath them. You reach Sisikon via winding steps and with a wonderful view of the surrounding mountains. The valley station of the Tw\u00e4rr\u00fcti-Buggialp cable car is above Sisikon. It offers a panoramic journey with a view over Lake Lucerne to the Rigi and the Pilatus."

After an underpass, continue along the banks of the Birs, where the rushing water drowns out the noise of the road.

Dead-straight dry-stone walls stretch across the hills, where several mountain farms lie between extensive Jura pastures. ",

The old Rhine bridge (Alte Rheinbr\u00fccke) is 135 m long and connects Vaduz with the village of Sevelen in the Canton St. Gallen. It is the last surviving bridge across the Alpine Rhine. Out of 15 wooden bridges in the St.Gallen Rhine Valley, it is the only one that has withstood all floods and fires. On the next section to Sevelen the route follows the main road. Past the ruins of Procha castle and through the villages of Fontnas and Azmoos it takes roughly two more hours to get to Tr\u00fcbbach. ",
            "Beautiful forest roads and a path take you to the old iron ore mine of Gonzen. The mining resulted in a labyrinth of tunnels and galleries of just under 90 km. In the 15th century the ore was used by the old confederates to make the dreaded cut and thrust weapons. Some of the traffic noise can be heard even on the forest paths. Continue through well-tended residential neighbourhoods with views across the Rhine Valley and the Sargans region until you get to the Sargans castle a short while later. The structure was purchased by the community of Sargans in the late 19th century to save it from crumbling. Just a few more minutes and you\u2019ll arrive at the Sargans train station, the destination of this first, long stage of the Via Alpina, but the first Alpine pass has yet to be crossed."

Over the Col de la Forcla, sometimes already snow-covered in autumn, face to face with the Grand and Petit Muveran down to Ovronnaz, where weary hikers can plunge into a warm thermal spa."

The incredible work of our forefathers is particularly striking here. They built the conduit on the mountainside with their bare hands, just a narrow channel made of boards and hugging the rocks. It was replaced in 1831 with a 95-m tunnel through which the water now flows. In 2019 the old channel was memorialised on the Swiss 100-franc bill and now the meaning is mostly sentimental. Still, this passage is head-spinning because there is a hole in the middle of the tunnel leading to a platform.

            "The classic Poschiavo hike takes us into the Val da Camp, now part of the Federal Inventory of Landscapes and Cultural Monuments of National Importance. It is a hike characterised by pastures, high-plateaus and lakes",
            "The Val da Camp is reached either on foot or with the small postbus from Sfaz\u00f9. Cars are not allowed here, so a reservation is recommended if you want to save yourself the walk up to the Alp da Camp. The postbus snakes its way up on a gravel road through the idyllic nature reserve and past the settlements of Buril, Salva, Mottacalva and Lungacqua. The backdrop on arrival: lush green meadows, alpine flowers and a magnificent mountain world. Shortly after the start, the paths fork to the lakes of Lagh da Saoseo and Lagh da Val Viola. The hiking tour can be done in both directions. It winds its way between pine and larch forests and open alpine meadows to the two lakes which have a landslide area in between.",
            "The better-known lake is the Lagh da Saoseo. It makes you think of an optical illusion: deep blue and intensely luminous, it is considered to be one of the most beautiful mountain lakes in Switzerland. With its wild shore full of stones and tree trunks, it is popular with landscape photographers. How did it get its incredible colour? Legend has it that a rock spirit is reflected in the water. The princess had to find him, because only then would she be allowed to marry the prince. Her patience paid off: when the spirit showed itself, she threw a few blue flowers into the water. As a result, the lake took on their colour - and has retained it to this day. ",
            "Rather dark violet in colour, as its name suggests, the Lagh da Val Viola nestles in the gentle hollow at the foot of the Scima da Saoseo. It has the shape of an eye and is surrounded by larches and pines. From the lake, you have a clear view of the Val Mera opposite. Please note: the Val da Camp and especially the area around the Lagh da Saoseo are heavily frequented in summer. If possible, it is better not to plan this hike on a weekend during the high season."

            "Starting at Neuhausen Rheinfall rail station, the Schaffhausen Border Trail takes you past the roaring waterfall into the silent forests of Schaffhausen's South Randen area. There is evidence that bean ore (limonite) was mined in this region from the 16th century onwards, and probably since Roman times. Pits that were excavated long ago have often become valuable habitats for native animal and plant species today. Along the way, you'll come to the Aazheimerhof, built in 1598 as the farm estate and summer residence of the Abbots of Rheinau. The estate has belonged to the City of Schaffhausen since 1936, and it is farmed and used by tenants.",
            "From national boundary stone no. 55, you follow the line of the border. At boundary stone no. 67, an erratic block of rock (also known as the \"Grey Stone\") rises out of a bean ore mine. This is the point where the districts of Beringen, Neunkirch and Jestetten (Germany) meet. The Linth glacier probably transported this huge boulder here from the Glarus or St. Gallen Oberland regions during the Riss glaciation, well over 200,000 years ago. The magnificent forest area between Erlenboden and the Wasen Hut is home to Sika deer, a breed that originated in China. ",
            "From the ruins of Radegg Castle, towering over the Wangen Valley on a rocky spur of Rossberg mountain, you will have a beautiful sweeping view of the Klettgau Valley where vines dominate the landscape. The walls of the castle are still visible, and the barbecue area is an inviting spot for a break. Mentioned for the first time in 1472, Bad Osterfingen is known today for its winery and country inn. The villagescape of Osterfingen, which is protected and mentioned in the Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites (ISOS), provides an excellent setting to sample a choice Schaffhausen Pinot Noir."

            "The hike starts with an ascent in the forest and continues along the Simmen falls to the first highlight: the Barbara bridge. From here, the stormy Simmen falls can not only be seen and heard, but also felt on one's own body in the form of water splashes. Here, masses of water cascade over the rocks and envelop the surroundings in mist. The bridge or dam in front of the waterfall serves as a barrier to divert the rising Simme. This measure was taken as early as the late 18th century to protect the valley from flooding. Barbara was the name of the wife of the Kurhaus director at the time, who made it possible to open up the Simmen falls and the barrage to tourists. ",
            "The route then winds its way up through the forest. Deep gorges can be observed, chiselled into the rock by the Simme. Before reaching Alp Rezlibergli, the terrain becomes somewhat more level, but the hike is all the more exhilarating as you detour to the seven springs of the Simme. At the foot of a mighty limestone wall, the Simme foams to the surface. In summer, up to 2800 litres per second flow from the seven springs. This fascinating natural spectacle and the surrounding mountain meadows with fireplaces invite you to linger. ",
            "The second ascent is another strenuous one. The highest point of the hike is reached at the historic Langermatte, where, according to legend, the \"women\u2019s battle\" was once fought. Today you\u2019ll find an alpine cheese dairy here; another follows on Alp Ritz. From Langermatte via alpine pastures, Iffigenalp is reached all too quickly. At the end of the hike, a sun terrace awaits you in the stately Berghaus. Tip: On your return to the village of Lenk, you pass the Iffig waterfall. Whether on foot or by bus, be sure to take a look at the fall, where masses of water plunge around 120 metres over the rocks."

They are also of interest architecturally. Take, for example, the Sontga Gada church which you pass on the walk. The walls of this 12th century Romanesque chapel are decorated with ancient frescoes. In earlier times, there is said to have been a Celtic place of worship here. Then you go via Cuoz to Segnas, which is listed in the Swiss Inventory of Sites Worth Protecting (ISOS). The houses are built in typical Walser style using interlocking logs (\"Strickbau\") and, while weathered by the sun, are very well maintained. In Acletta, the next stopping place, you must visit the baroque chapel of Maria Immaculata with its wonderful architecture inside and the famous painting of the Madonna by Carlo Francesco Nuvolone, dating back to 1672. ",

In Clavaniev, the old heart of the village has remained unspoilt with many small barns, a dairy and a wooden baker's oven at the entrance to the village. The route takes you via Turtengia and then through the forest to the former gallows at Fuortga, of which you can still see the two stone columns.

The hike starts on the south side of the Gotthard Pass. Until Quinto you are mostly close to the motorway and able to gloat a bit when you look at the heavy traffic on the Gotthard route.

With a maximum gradient of 87.8% it is one of the world\u2019s steepest funiculars. It leads to the Lago di Ritom reservoir in the area of the Lukmanier Pass. Cross the Ticino and continue following a forest path to Quinto where you cross the river again and turn into the forest. After the next, fairly short wooded section the lovely hike ends in Rodi. ",
            "Before the construction of the Gotthard railway, Rodi was highly dependent on the Piottino gorge. The first path crossing the gorge was built in the 14th century. Later, the Roman Road led from Rodi along the western side of the valley to Monte Piottino and finally down to Prato. The \u201cUrner Saumweg\u201d (mule track of Uri) was not built until the 16th century and led directly through the gorge. This is when the Dazio Grande customs house was built, because the gorge formed the border between Swiss and Milanese territory. For a long time Rodi consisted of only this one building for the transfer of goods. At the same time, it also served as a toll station and customs office. Today, the Dazio Grande is open to guests, offering a country-style restaurant, overnight accommodations and an exhibit about the gorge."

You cross the steep slope on a surfaced path. At the top, you find yourself on wide Jura pastures with grazing horses. Beyond the village of Moron, the path runs downwards once more onto the plain.",
            "Just before Bellelay, you turn left onto the plains to the south. The town is famous for its impressive abbey, founded in 1136 and secularised in 1797. The property is now used as a psychiatric hospital. The monks of the abbey developed T\u00eate de Moine cheese in the 12th century, and its traditional production over a wood fire can be experienced in the on-site museum.",

You pass the La Rouge Eau source on the left before arriving at the bus stop. Carts from Roman times have left impressive tracks in this area.",
            "Shortly after this, the trail leads between the hills of Moron and Montbautier, along an attractive tree-lined road and then to the right. A route with bends takes you up the eastern slope through the forest. There are steep cliffs either side of the trail, which culminates in an incredible view over the Vall\u00e9e de Tavannes. You come across blooming daffodils and ancient trees as well as attractive, slightly crumbling drystone walls on the way to the large farm on Montbautier.",
            "Straight trails lead past striking trees dotted here and there and along impressive tree-lined roads. The road takes you past the Haut de B\u00e9mont farm. It is now a leisurely hike over the crest of the hill to Le Chalet. Coniferous trees, a whole variety of flowers and the view of the Chasseral delight the senses. You reach the highest point of the hike at 1,169 metres and this is followed by the descent to Tramelan.",
            "Located on the southern hillside, Tramelan was closely associated with watchmaking up to the 1970s. The home workshops, the temple church windows and the church of St. Michel invite you to explore."

            "Those with the courage and the desire to get just that little bit closer to the breathtaking Eiger North Face and tackle a superlative high alpine adventure can take the Jungfrau Railway to the station at Eigergletscher and set out on the Eiger Trail. Shortly after starting on this route, you'll find yourself right in front of the famous rock face itself, and above you to the right you'll notice the metal ladders that climbers to the Eiger-Rotstock Via Ferrata use to gain access. From here on, the trail runs for an hour along the foot of the Eiger North Face, sparkling with a beautiful view over the Wetterhorn and the Grosse Scheidegg.",
            "Difficult sections are secured with ropes. If you have brought your binoculars, you'll be able to see the climbers up against the rock face. The train station sells postcards that show all the routes up this mountain. Towards the end of the tour the trail zigzags boldly down to Alpiglen train station."

            "Hiking into the wild, untouched Vallon de R\u00e9chy, past extended low moors with rare plants. The trail describes a loop to the Le Louch\u00e9 mountain lake where wildlife is often spotted. Start and destination is the Cr\u00eat-du-Midi mountain, easy to reach by gondola offering magnificent views.",
            "Hidden between Val d'H\u00e9rens and Val d'Anniviers is another unspoiled valley called Vallon de R\u00e9chy. The thinly populated valley is one of the last without traffic and roads in the Valais region. But the natural streams, mountain lakes, extended low moorlands and unusual plants make it a worthwhile hiking destination. The three elevations of the valley - each with its own appeal - can be explored on this tour.",
            "The starting point of the hike is the Cr\u00eat-du-Midi mountain ridge, just above the edge of the forest. To get there, take the gondola from Vercorin. An absolute must-see is the panoramic view across the Rhone Valley in the direction of the Bernese and Valais Alp, far into Val d'Anniviers and to Bella Tola on the other side. The trail leads downhill along the valley\u2019s eastern slope with unending views of forests, meadows and clearings along the way. The first passage ends with a natural plateau called Le Pichioc, where the water of the La R\u00e8che mountain stream tumbles over a glistening waterfall.",
            "The moor landscape Ar du Tsan forms the middle valley where a serpentine river meanders through the large, swampy basin. Especially the upper part of the valley is home to many rare species of plants. The turning point of the tour is the mountain lake of Le Louch\u00e9 all the way back in the valley, a tranquil and relaxing spot. With a little luck, you may be able to observe some of the wildlife that peacefully lives here. The area is surrounded by mountains: Becs de Bosson, the rocky peak of La Maya and Roc d'Orzival. The route continues downhill through the valley\u2019s east side, ultimately reaching the Cr\u00eat-du-Midi on the same path."

The R\u00f6ti, the highest point between Weissenstein and Balmberg, is reached after a short climb in the opposite direction.

There, some 200 plants typical of the Solothurn Jura and the neighbouring areas can be admired in a botanical garden. They are lovingly tended and labelled with signs between June and September. Adventure seekers will have fun at the rope park on the Balmberg: with its ten courses, it is one of the largest in Switzerland, including several tyroliennes up to 174 metres long."

This is high above B\u00fcrglen and Altdorf with magnificent views of the surrounding mountains. The hike also offers much with regards to flora and fauna. A lot of rainfall and impermeable grounds have given way to many moors. Those moors are the habitat of many rare and protected plants and animals. If you look carefully you might see many wild species, amongst them red deer, chamois, marmots, rabbits, foxes and badgers. Golden eagles can also quite often be seen in the valley of Sch\u00e4chental.",

After Heidmanegg, the path will lead you on narrow tracks through ever changing, light forests at \u00c4bnet and through open and flowery alpine meadows. Above Ratzi the path then follows again a wider track to Biel. Then you walk through the hollow of Selez before reaching the little lake of Fleschsee.

Now you continue downhill, first along a path and later on a forest road heading for the destination. Beinwil in the Canton Solothurn is located on the Passwang road.

Once on the water, you can experience the rich biodiversity of Lake Lucerne. It was formed during the ice ages through erosion of the Reuss Glacier; the Reuss River, with a length of 164 kilometres, has its source in the Gotthard Massif. It leaves Lake Lucerne as a wide river with many bends and joins the Aare River at Windisch (330 metres above sea level) in the Canton of Aargau. The lake's name dates back to the four historic cantons surrounding it: Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden. ",
            "Offering breath-taking views of the Rigi and B\u00fcrgenstock, the boat after Viznau turns to enter the next lake basin. It feels like travelling on a small lake, but another lake basin opens up after each headland. At Brunnen, the boat turns into the Urnersee lake. On the right, you can see the R\u00fctli. On a slightly raised forest clearing, representatives of the original cantons in 1291 swore the oath of allegiance (R\u00fctlischwur), determining a joint approach to combat the foreign bailiffs in their valleys. It became the foundation for the Swiss Confederacy. ",
            "Axenstrasse runs along the left side of the lake. Until the road was built, the waterway served as the only connection to the north. After landing at Fl\u00fcelen, the route continues on foot for a short while toward the Canton of Uri's capital. Passing the commercial zone, swimming baths and a bird park, you follow the river until shortly before Altdorf. On the way, the beautiful, almost 2-metre-high drystone walls will grab your attention, in addition to the 3,000-metre high Bristen. In Altdorf, about an hour after arrival by boat, the same can be said about the well-preserved old houses.

A cross adorns the summit of the Hasenmatt, with Lake Biel extending out far below. This is the highest point of the stage. Along the typical stone walls of the Jura, the trail follows the Jura Crest before the steady decline begins.",
            "This is another chance to enjoy the spellbinding views all the way down to Lake Biel, before the trail finally descends into dense forest. Houses start to dot the landscape in various clearings, and you soon reach Plagne, the first village after the linguistic border. With 361 residents, this is the smallest village in the Bernese Jura. From Plagne, it is a little over an hour\u2019s walk to Frinvillier, where a bit of a culture shock awaits. The peace and tranquillity of the Jura Crest Trail stands in stark contrast to the various motorways that lead directly into the village. The destination today lies directly between these motorways."

Queste ultime si estendono oltre il confine linguistico tedesco-francese nei cantoni di Friburgo, Berna e Vaud. Il paesaggio \u00e8 variegato e presenta montagne, laghi, riserve naturali e paesaggi plasmati dai ghiacciai. ",

Dopo la discesa verso il fiume Sense, si attraversa l'ultimo ponte di legno coperto della citt\u00e0. Il ponte di Berna fu fatto a pezzi durante un attacco dei bernesi nel 1340 per bloccare la strada al nemico.

Poco dopo, nel 1784, il suo tetto in scandole di legno fu colpito da un proiettile, dopodich\u00e9 mezza chiesa fu nuovamente bruciata. Le torbiere in quota di Entemoos e Rotmoos fanno parte di questo comune. Anticamente, da queste due riserve naturali si estraeva la torba.",

Le splendide Alpi sono una costante di questo paesaggio. Poco prima della fine della tappa, si raggiunge il confine con il Parco naturale del Gantrisch, dove oltre alle esperienze naturalistiche si promuovono la biodiversit\u00e0 e il buio. Una volta giunti a Plaffeien, salta all'occhio la pi\u00f9 grande chiesa neoromanica del cantone. Questa vivace localit\u00e0 \u00e8 considerata il centro economico dell'altopiano della regione di Sense. Fribourg is a bilingual medieval university town with eleven historic fountains, over 200 Gothic facades and plenty of charm. The cathedral, with its beautiful glass windows and the 74-metre-high viewing tower, is awe-inspiring. Once you have climbed the 365 steps, lovely views over the entire city and the Fribourg Pre-Alps beckon. They stretch across the German-French language border in the cantons of Fribourg, Bern and Vaud. The countryside is stunning and diverse, with its mountains, lakes, nature reserves, and primaeval landscapes created by glaciers. ",
            "The stage begins at Fribourg railway station and initially leads through the narrow alleyways of the historic old town to the cathedral. After descending to the Sense, you cross the last covered wooden bridge in the city. The Bern Bridge was sawn up during an attack by the Bernese in 1340 to cut off the enemy's way. Now comes the ascent beside the Gott\u00e9ron gorge and along rock faces up to the rectangular D\u00fcrrenbuhl tower.",
            "Passing the tower, you reach the Notre Dame de Bourguillon church between the forest and settlement area. The place is popular with pilgrims and was a refuge for people suffering from leprosy in the Middle Ages. A beautiful path follows through pasture and forest sections in the hilly landscape of the Senseland to St. Ursen. ",
            "Over a plateau with superb views, the hike continues to Rechthalten. The local parish church of St. German burnt down after being struck by lightning and was consecrated again in 1768. As early as 1784, its wooden shingle roof was hit by a bullet, after which half the church burnt down again. The Entemoos and Rotmoos upland moors are part of the municipality. Peat used to be cut from the two nature reserves.",
            "The route's highest point, the Buechench\u00e4ppeli, is reached via narrow paths and stairs. Continue on gravel and asphalt roads to Plaffeien. The magnificent Alps are always in sight. Shortly before the end of the stage, you reach the border to the Gantrisch Nature Park, where biodiversity and darkness are promoted in addition to nature experiences. Arriving in Plaffeien, the largest neo-Romanesque church in the canton catches the eye. The lively town is considered the economic centre of the Sense Oberland."

Nowadays cars are held up in traffic jams before they get to the tunnel, but for hikers the way is clear.",

Along the Reuss and past the Alpine golf course of Andermatt you reach Hospental, the last stop before the path begins to climb.

From now on it takes stamina: the route climbs from 1450 m to 2107 m at the top of the pass. It first follows the old post coach road of 1830. On the historic mule trail (marked as a mountain hiking trail) you feel taken back in time, as landscape and vegetation become more and more Alpine, more spectacular. Between Gamssteg and M\u00e4tteli you cross mountain pastures, while the road traffic rolls on. The ventilation system on top of a knoll is an indication of the road tunnel directly below it. Near Br\u00fcggloch you cross the border between Uri and the Ticino. On the last section of the path the transportation routes of three eras come together: the age-old mule trail, the old road of 1830 across the pass and the new road, which is protected against falling rocks. The path leads through a moor landscape with a wide variety of Alpine flora. ",

After about 4 hours of walking you finally reach the destination. The Gotthard Pass is swarming with mountain bikes, motorcycles and cars. Time for a break at one of the small lakes or maybe a visit to the national St. Gotthard Museum.

            "The world\u2019s steepest cogwheel railway with a maximum gradient of 48% travels from Alpnachstad to the summit of Mt. Pilatus. Lucerne\u2019s very own mountain was once known as a source of treacherous storms and floods as well as the home of dragons and other monsters. It is said that the mountain took its name from Pontius Pilate, the governor of a Roman province at the time of Jesus Christ. Legend has it that he was buried in the lake at the mountain top. The route starts at Pilatus Kulm. It heads down to the valley and offers a magnificent view across the lakes of Central Switzerland, the city of Lucerne and countless mountain peaks. Within about a two-hour walk, it descends approximately 1000 meters in altitude, first on a steep path followed by a gravel road and surrounded by craggy mountain cliffs and blossoming meadows. ",
            "After L\u00fctholdsmatt the route goes gently uphill again. A broad gravel road leads to W\u00e4ngen where it briefly changes to a path. Taking a look behind you now and then, toward the start of today\u2019s tour and to Stanserhorn Mountain on the other side, is well worth it. After hiking more than four hours, an attractive two-hour section starts at Chr\u00fczliegg and continues to Schlierengrat, going gently up and down along the white-red-white trail markers. Through blueberry bushes, past gnarled pines and spruce, some of which have died off, you reach B\u00e4rnerstig, an old crossing to the Entlebuch region.  ",
            "Next you pass through a fantastic moorland area leading to Schwendi Kaltbad, once a recognized health resort with a sanatorium. It was known for the healing power of its mud and sulphur baths. In the summer, Alpine church services and weddings are held in the small chapel. It doesn\u2019t take long to get to Langis from here, the end of this lovely, but sometimes strenuous hike. Langis is located above Lake Sarnen. It is popular with cross-country skiers as well as winter and snowshoe hikers. In the summer, it is an insider tip among nature enthusiasts because of the beautiful protected moor landscape with birches, pine trees and mountain meadows."

The first 400 altitude meters could have been cut short, as Nidwalden is known as the cable car region. Many of these were built to provide access to remote pastures and alps and most of them are also used for tourism. A last look back at the Walenst\u00f6cke Mountains is recommended before dipping into Steinalper Forest. The 57-hectare forest protection area is known for its wide variety of lichens, including very rare and endangered species. ",
            "Car-free Niederrickenbach on the other side of the forest is a small village known as a pilgrimage destination. It is situated around the Maria Rickenbach Benedictine monastery. The latter was built in 1864 north of the St. Maria pilgrimage chapel at Ahorn. The statue of St. Maria which is housed here is shrouded in legend. It is said to have been saved by a young shepherd when images of catholic saints were destroyed during the Reformation. The young man hid the statue in a hollow maple tree on the mountain. When he was ready to return to the valley in the fall, he could not remove the statue from the tree. It was impossible to do so until a chapel was built at that location. This was the beginning of the pilgrimage. About 15,000 people have visited Niederrickenbach every year during the 19th century.",
            "Uphill, past beautiful mountain maples, you approach the Brisenhaus SAC hut at 1753 m. It is today\u2019s destination of the tour, reached in just two more hours. The hut is located at the foot of majestic Brisen Mountain (2404 m) and offers marvellous long-distance views of Mt. Pilatus, Rigi Mountain and the Mittelland region."

            "This is an easy hike, following one of the many paths of the so-called pastoral migration. Humans and animals kept moving around, depending on the season, always in search of water. The loop trail explores the sophisticated antique irrigation system and ends with the emerald green waters of the Verzasca river.",
            "Thinking of Lavertezzo and the Verzasca Valley conjures up the arched stone bridge spanning the emerald green river. Images of natural swimming pools and an enticing dip arise. It\u2019s hard to believe that this valley once suffered a water shortage. But this is how it was. The old irrigation system with its catch basins, carved into the rocks, is what the easy loop hike along the Verzasca river is all about. ",
            "The trail starts near the church of Lavertezzo and climbs up to Sambugaro. Part of it follows the paths of the travelling farmers. These paths were used by semi-nomadic herdsmen to take the cattle to different summer pastures. The huts of Rev\u00f6ira, consisting of five settlement centres, and Ca d D\u00e9nt were inhabited in spring and fall. Some elements of the old irrigation system are seen here. Visible on the entire slope are 35 hollowed out, vat-like granite blocks holding about 4800 litres of rainwater. Six cisterns collected the groundwater to provide the \u201cblue gold\u201d to households and cattle. ",
            "Looking at the steep slopes above the pastures it is difficult to imagine how the grass was cut here. The hay was transported by hay bands. The points of impact can still be seen. The forest in the Verzasca Valley was used far into the 20th century for coal and timber production. When trees were cut, the slopes lost their hold. The forest where the path now leads had to be reforested to protect the road. Back down in the valley, the route continues to the Motta hamlet and shortly thereafter to a bridge crossing the Verzasca river. The path now turns and follows the right side of the river. Mostly in the forest it continues, sometimes over a flight of steps, to Lavertezzo. The crystal-clear, emerald torrent flows through the valley, roaring and foaming at times, quiet and serene at others. The double-arched Ponte dei Salti shortly before the destination is a popular photo spot. The natural bathtubs created by erosion are often used for swimming \u2013 a perfect end before the return to the village."

This chalet perpetuates the tradition of artisanal cheese making with its master cheese maker, known as an armailli. From the 15th to the start of the 19th century, Alpine farms could employ up to a dozen people, from the master cheese maker to the shepherd, the bou\u00e8be (chalet boy), the milker, the cutter and the barlat\u00e8 (who was responsible for taking the cheese down to the village and bringing supplies and news back to the chalet). The occupation became less important with the appearance of dairies in the villages in the 1830s. Today, the armaillis and their products are back in vogue.",

            "The Toblerone Trail owes its name to a line of fortifications built during the 1939-45 mobilization. The population christened the anti-tank blocks \u00abToblerones\u00bb because their shape recalls a Swiss chocolate brand.",
            "Its name might suggest otherwise, but the Toblerone Trail will appeal more to history-lovers than those with a sweet tooth. \"Toblerones\" was the popular name for the tank traps set up as defensive lines between Bassins and Nyon in the second world war. Their triangular shape recalls the \"peaks\" of a Toblerone chocolate bar, and that explains the name given to the 3,000 or so concrete triangles \u2013 each as tall as a man. The \"Toblerones\" are arrayed along a stretch of about ten kilometers between the Jura foothills and Lake Geneva. An educational trail focusing on history follows the traps.",
            "Around 1940, when German troops were attacking neutral countries such as Belgium and Norway, fears also reached very high levels in Switzerland. This prompted the start of construction work on the \"Promenthouse Defence Line\": chunks of concrete were set up one after another along the courses of rivers and streams. Instead of removing them again, some were restored as a reminder of the war's importance for Switzerland. But military history is only one interesting aspect of the hike along these \"Toblerones\". This is also a paradise for nature-lovers: the massive tank traps tend to prevent intensive cultivation of the land, so they are now wreathed in moss and ivy \u2013 a welcoming habitat for many plants and animals. Birds chirrup along the streams and above the canopy of greenery. From the fields, you can admire the views of Lake Geneva and the French Alps. ",
            "There are also some fascinating buildings along the way, such as the Villa Rose near Gland (a listed monument). This two-storey building is painted pale pink with green shutters. But Villa Rose is not a cosy home: in fact, it is an ingeniously designed fortress. The windows turn out to be fake, and even the toilet has disguised slits for shooting at the enemy! On reaching the shore of Lake Geneva, the route crosses the golf course of the Domaine Imp\u00e9rial club. There is an air of grandeur about the clubhouse here. No wonder: Napoleon's family once used it as a villa. The beach near Prangins brings this outing to an enchanting conclusion. A visit to the Swiss National Museum in Prangins Castle is also worthwhile \u2013 and, of course, a stroll through the pretty historic centre of Nyon, overlooked by the towers of Nyon castle."

Almost horizontally, it then crosses the big rocky plateau under the icy facade of the opposite moraine (left orographic) and descends towards Robiei after passing the courtyard of Randinascia.",
            "The itinerary is not particularly difficult from a technical point of view. However, some segments require caution, especially when crossing snowfields and watercourses. Indications given in the guidebook should be respected. As any other Alpine trail marked in white and red, it requires appropriate equipment for the terrain and for the mountain's unique weather conditions.",
            "As an initiative of the Ofima utility company the tunnel inside the Robiei dam is now open to the public: it's now possible to visit the interior of one of the infrastructures that have profoundly modified the landscape of the high Bavona Valley. The dams are imposing concrete constructions conceived by mankind's ingenuity to accumulate enormous quantities of water for the production of hydroelectric power. The educational itinerary explains how dams are integrated into the water's natural cycle and illustrates different construction techniques, security control and the transformation of the water's force into electricity. The interesting walk through the dam's tunnels is unique in Ticino and is free of charge. The key to access it is held by the Robiei Hotel and can be picked up in exchange for ID. The temperature inside the dam is about 8\u00b0C and humidity is high: we recommend bringing adequate clothing.",

The most widespread vine in the Italian part of Switzerland (82%) is precisely that same Merlot that distinguishes the production of Bordeaux, and that today is also made into whites with excellent results. To understand the relationship Merlot has to Ticino, we suggest an itinerary that takes you to the places where the first stumps of this variety were planted over a century ago and a visit to the \"Corte del vino\" which stocks 200 Ticino vintages.\n                                ",

            "The introduction of the Merlot wine in Ticino dates back to approximately a century ago. Its farming, that gradually superseded native varieties, was strongly promoted by the government after the Ticino vineyards were destroyed, like those of most of Europe, by the grape phylloxera, a disease originating in America.",
            "In Ticino the wines produced with the Merlot grape took a long time to assert themselves. Some wine cooperatives and some firms started to promote this production towards the end of the 1900s. It was especially the Matasci company from Tenero to introduce the Ticino Merlot North of the Alps, with its ",

            "However, Ticino's oenological revolution dates back to the '80s and is connected to a group of Swiss-German intellectuals with an academic background, that chose Ticino as their adoptive homeland attracted by the climate and the Latin culture. It was this group, lead by Christian Z\u00fcndel, Daniel Huber, Werner Stucky and Adrian Kaufmann, that innovated the canton's oenological world and proposed wines influenced by the Bordeaux tradition. Simultaneously, some \"fathers\" of Ticino's modern oenology - Fabio Arnaboldi, Luigi Zanini, Cesare Valsangiacomo, Claudio Tamborini and Sergio Monti - also followed the same direction and went to study at the University of Bordeaux. Today a growing number of youth, after having studied oenology, choose to return to Ticino to setup a winemaking business with their own grapes.",

This passage, at the valley's narrowing point, is the only access to the North.",

Castelgrande, that in the 80s and 90s was subject to an accurate restoration directed by the architect Aurelio Galfettti, is equipped with two high towers and crenulated walls that are partially accessible on foot. It houses a museum illustrating the history of the city as well as temporary exhibits, and a good restaurant managed by the Canton Ticino Tourism School.",
            "The site on which Castelgrande stands is rich in history and archaeological findings unearthed during excavations in 1984-85 confirm that the site was inhabited as far back as the Neolithic period (5500-5000 B.C.) and date back to Roman times. Excavations in 1967 brought to light evidence of the first fortification from the 4th century A.C. Documents dating from the 6th century. also mention the existence of this first defensive construction. The castle as we see it today was built in various stages and has undergone several restorations. The castle construction began in the 13th century; it was enlarged in 1473-86 and later restored in the 17th and 19th centuries. The White and Black Tower date from the 13th and 14th centuries and are respectiverly 27 and 28 meters high. ",
            "Architect Mr. Aurelio Galfetti carried out the latest extensive restorations in 1984-1991. The inner courtyard, the entrances, the elevator and the steps leading down to the town center are a stunning exemplification of the castle\u2019s transformation. ",

At the time of the Visconti, this remaining bulwark reached down as far as the river Ticino. It was built in the late 14th century and fortified by the Sforza dukes of Milan between 1486 and 1489. In 1515 parts of the wall were destroyed by a terrible flood.",
            "The elengance of the 27-metre-high White Tower (1250-1350) and the impressiveness of the 28-metre-high Black Tower (1310) are also worth mentioning.

The defensive walls of the old town originate here and join up with those from San Michele hill. There are still parts of both branches of these walls protecting the north and south sides of the fortress. The internal nucleus of the castle dates back to the 13th/14th century and has been restored several times.",
            "Most probably, it was built by the Rusca family of Como who kept it for a long period of time, even during the rule of the Viscontis. The external courtyards with the towers and the \"Rivellino\" were built by Sforza-engineers in the second half of the 15th century During Swiss occupation, the castle was called Castello di Svitto but it was renamed Castello di San Martino when Ticino became an independent canton. Towards the end of the 18th century, the castle was acquired by the Ghiringhelli family who ceded it to the Canton in 1903 on the occasion of the first centenary of independence. ",

It can be reached both from Montebello by following the stretches of trails through the vineyards and the stretches of road, accessible also by car. It houses exhibition halls and an excellent restaurant. ",
            "The Sforzas built the third castle, called Sasso Corbaro after the hill on which it stands, in 1479 after the defeat of the Milanese troops at the Battle of Giornico. It was designed and completed in the incredibly brief time of 6 months by the military engineer Benedetto Ferrini of Florence who died of the plague shortly before its completion. Its dominant position, 230 meters above the town, meant better protection of the Ticino Valley. The Castle, starkly geometrical in shape, stands in a square courtyard enclosed by high walls which are as much as 7 meters thick at the point where they join the keep on the northern side. In the square courtyard enclosed by high walls is the donjon (or keep) with its mighty walls reaching 7 metres in thickness.",
            "The lookout tower on the southern side is still almost intact. During early Swiss occupation, the castle was known as the Castle of Unterwalden but was renamed Castle of Santa Barbara in 1818. Today it is called Sasso Corbaro or Castello di Cima.",
            "It was abandoned in 1798 and started to deteriorate. It would have fallen into complete disrepair had the Canton not interceded in 1870, handing it over to an organization, which planned to turn it into a hotel, and later to three Bellinzona-families who transformed it into a summer residence. In 1919, the state regained possession of the castle and began a restoration that included the rebuilding of the \"Rivellino\" (or outer courtyard), the entrance gates, the 17th century chapel and the well.

This particular aspect allows the study of evolution over the course of millions of years, from determined groups of organisms in the same environment.

            "\n                                The Vincenzo Vela Museum, that exposes the works of the Ticino sculptor, belongs to the group of the most important artist's houses of the European 1800s. Built by the great realist sculptor Vincenzo Vela (1820-1891) at the peak of his career, the villa was transformed into a public museum after being donated to the Swiss Confederation. From 1997 to 2001 the building was entirely restructured by the renowned Ticino architect ",
            "\n                                ",
            "The Vincenzo Vela Museum collections reflect the specificity of the home-museum of a man, Vincenzo Vela, who was actively engaged in his time, both as an artist and as a patriot. In the midst of approximately 5'000 works what stands out is his plaster casts gallery, that surprises for its quality and monumental nature and which gathers original plaster models of most of his sculptures. Next to it you can admire terracotta and plaster drafts, that amaze for their fineness and completeness.",
            "The inheritance also includes over a thousand prints and drawings of which many by Vela himself, and a surprising collection of old photographs. These (about a thousand) represent one of the oldest collections of Swiss photography. ",
            "By Lorenzo Vela, Vincenzo's brother, renowned ornamentalist and animal sculptor, are preserved: a small collection of works in plaster and terracotta, especially animals, and some allegoric and genre figures.",
            "By painter Spartaco Vela, son of Vincenzo and donor of the Villa to the Swiss Confederation, many oil paintings in addition to preparatory and academic sketches are present. ",
            "The three artists of the Vela family were also collectors of contemporary art of that era, each following their personal taste and taking advantage of their respective friendships with colleagues and friends from the Academy. The three units, converging in the patrimony of the museum, hence form the largest collection of 19th century Lombardy and Piedmont paintings owned by the Swiss Confederation.",
            "The family library consists of over 1'500 volumes and can be an interesting departure point for the study of the creative process of many of Vincenzo Vela's monuments.",
            "Rightly considered benefactors of their community of origin, Ligornetto, the two most outstanding members of the Vela family, the artists Lorenzo and Vincenzo, came from humble origins. The father Giuseppe Vela (1780-1849) was a peasant, the mother Teresa Casanova (1782-1866) ran a tavern. Like many youth from the Mendrisio region, the two Vela brothers started working stone in the caves of Bisazio, Viaggi\u00f9 and Saltrio. Blessed with a unique talent, they achieved fame in nearby Milan, that welcomed Ticino's youth on the construction site of the Duomo or in the classrooms of the Brera Academy.",
            "The two sculptors never broke contact with their native town, demonstrating their attachment through generous gifts to the Ligornetto Commune. Lorenzo was one of the founders of the Societ\u00e0 di Mutuo Soccorso (1889) (Mutual Rescue Society) while Spartaco, the only son of Vincenzo and last direct descendant of the family who died at a young age, followed his father's wishes donating his villa and the collections preserved within to the Swiss Confederation, determining it as the perfect asset to become a museum and fine arts academy. If on the one hand the three artists' faith in liberal politics guaranteed commissions from and favoured attendance of the Italian Risorgimento and progressive environments, both in Lombardy as well as in Ticino, on the other hand their beliefs caused sour hostilities from Ticino conservatives who considered them anticlerical.",
            "Numerous are the testimonials of the Vela's presence in the small village of Ligornetto, from the commemorative tombstones to the fountains financed and decorated by the artists themselves. Important for its uniqueness is the grave of Vincenzo Vela in Ligornetto's cemetery, an extraordinary example of a tomb storied by a sculptor. It represents the deceased artist laying down. At his feet a trophy, with Masonic references and the distinctive features of the sculptor, that stands out for refinement in composition and iconographic complexity. \n                                "

Over the centuries the inhabitants abandoned the old village and moved to the one we know today. The reason for this move is intriguing and is related to emigration. In 1631, after about fifty Bergamese and Valtellina laborers quit their jobs at the Livorno border, some emigrants from Rasa together with others from Palagnedra, Ronco and Terree di Pedemonte, were fortunate to take their place marking the beginning of an era of prosperity and well-being in the little town of Rasa. In fact, those emigrants built elegant houses and financed religious buildings in the village's new abode located on a plain in a beautiful position. The church of Saint Anne dates back to the first half of the 1700s.",
            "As in the case of the other hamlet Bordei, over time the ancient village of Terra Vecchia was being reclaimed by nature and reduced to a collection of ruins, but both villages have been renovated by the Terra Vecchia Foundation dedicated to the recovery and rehabilitation of drug addicts.

When you reach the creek, climb up towards Bordei - another hamlet that breathes a new life thanks to the work coordinated by the Foundation - finally arriving in Palagnedra. The village counts numerous rustic houses adjacent to noble ones, a tangible trace of a successful emigration. In the choir of the old church of San  Michele an impressive collection of frescoes by Antonio da Tradate from the 1400s is preserved.

His goal was to build an environment capable of housing the richest collection of precious exotic plants, in compliance with the biological features of each species, while simultaneously satisfying both aesthetic and botanical requirements. Following its purchase, the property was readapted, with terracing and excavation works, in order to accommodate the park of his dreams.

From the description, the place seemed ideal to fulfill the Captain\u2019s life-long dream, namely the creation of one of the world\u2019s most beautiful botanical parks.

Even while studying at Eton and Oxford, he used to spend his holidays \u2013 as was customary for members of the elite \u2013 on the Mediterranean, painting Italian landscapes. He went on his first trip around the world aged just sixteen, repeating the experience five more times throughout his life, trawling the four corners of the earth in search of rare and unknown plant species to show and spread across Europe \u2013 and, most importantly, to display at his marvelous gardens surrounding Villa Taranto, where he lived until the year of his death in1964, aged 80.",

The Cianis enlarged and refurbished the existing building while, in parallel, they started building the park. They soon faced a difficult problem: periodic flooding of the property, caused both by the overflow of the Cassarate river and the lake into the parkland. The problem was resolved by building a containment wall and by raising the property by one and a half meters above the lake surface. In 1912 the villa and the park were purchased by the city of Lugano.\n                                "
