Curzútt is proof that people once used to prefer living at higher altitudes, for many reasons: for one, the shores of the Ticino were often under water. The climate in the plain increased the risk of malaria. Plus, Bellinzona was an embattled town back then and the valley was located in a strategic position for passing armies and soldiers. The elaborately restored village contains typical stone houses, vegetable gardens, terrace-like grain fields and vineyards. Dry stone walls and an old mule track were also renovated. However, Curzútt is not meant to be a museum. It also has a youth hostel and a restaurant.

Not to worry, it is not a forest fire. It is just the fumes of the smoldering charcoal kilns. The charburners of Romoos are building conical piles of different kinds of wood. Then they light them to generate charcoal. They monitor the process around the clock for a good two weeks. The production of “black gold” is hard work. ", "For centuries the farmers have been producing charcoal as a secondary income. Romoos once had around 200 charburning places because blacksmiths, iron foundries and glassworks needed a great deal of charcoal then. Nowadays, the ancient craft is practiced by just a few farmers from the Napf area. They still produce as much as 100 tons every year. Making air holes, adding burnable material, extracting charcoal – with a bit of luck, you might be able to peek over the workers’ shoulders on the hike between Romoos and Bramboden. Signs along the way also provide information about the charburning craft, about gold prospectors and about natural phenomena in the region.

The route via Rose-Beizli, which is a little off the path, descends to the Seelibach brook and finally to Bramboden, crisscrossing Lucerne’s Napf area. It passes steep cliffs and waterfalls, snakes through narrow ravines and climbs over sunny ridges. The area around Romoos is often compared to the Centovalli in the Ticino because of the similar topography. Bramboden, a place of pilgrimage, is a veritable gem. It is located in a side valley of the Entlebuch, far from any other village. A visit to the lovely mountain church, dedicated to St. Antonius of Padua, should not be missed, and the Pilgerbeizli restaurant is a perfect place to end the day."]},

The route starts to climb in Tremona and first stops at the archaeological finds in Tremona-Castello. The remains of a settlement allow a detailed re-enactment of life in a farming village in the Middle Ages and can be explored with 3D-glasses. Meride is reached later at 586 m. Its narrow winding lanes, antique buildings and lovely courtyards are under landmark protection. The museum, designed by famous Ticino architect Mario Botta, has 230 million year-old fossils from Monte San Giorgio on exhibit. The area around the mountain was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003 because it has the world’s best marine fossil record from the Triassic Period (230 to 245 million years ago). ", "Not far from the museum is the observation terrace of Val Mara. Within sight of the striking limestone cliff it offers insight into the prehistoric marine deposits and fossils. The route continues up toward Monte San Giorgio at 1000 m. First on a broad mule track shaded by dense forest, then on a relatively flat trail we arrive in Cassina and its chapel. The last part to the top is quite steep, but worth the effort. The view across the Ticino Alps and Lake Lugano is awesome. In bad weather, the San Giorgio church offers shelter. An enjoyable refuge at Alpe di Brusino is reached by a steep forest path. The grotto on the alp serves typical regional specialities in a lovely ambiance from April to October, surrounded by ancient chestnut trees.

In addition to the Hauenstein summit tunnel itself, the viaduct near Rümlingen is particularly impressive. It is 128 metres long and consists of eight arches. This structure has often inspired artists such as Ferdinand Hodler. Under the viaduct, the route moves away from the railway line a second time.

It was replaced in 1831 with a 95-m tunnel through which the water now flows. In 2019 the old channel was memorialised on the Swiss 100-franc bill and now the meaning is mostly sentimental. Still, this passage is head-spinning because there is a hole in the middle of the tunnel leading to a platform.

Images of natural swimming pools and an enticing dip arise. It’s hard to believe that this valley once suffered a water shortage. But this is how it was. The old irrigation system with its catch basins, carved into the rocks, is what the easy loop hike along the Verzasca river is all about. ", "The trail starts near the church of Lavertezzo and climbs up to Sambugaro. Part of it follows the paths of the travelling farmers. These paths were used by semi-nomadic herdsmen to take the cattle to different summer pastures. The huts of Revöira, consisting of five settlement centres, and Ca d Dént were inhabited in spring and fall. Some elements of the old irrigation system are seen here. Visible on the entire slope are 35 hollowed out, vat-like granite blocks holding about 4800 litres of rainwater. Six cisterns collected the groundwater to provide the “blue gold” to households and cattle. ", "Looking at the steep slopes above the pastures it is difficult to imagine how the grass was cut here. The hay was transported by hay bands. The points of impact can still be seen. The forest in the Verzasca Valley was used far into the 20th century for coal and timber production. When trees were cut, the slopes lost their hold. The forest where the path now leads had to be reforested to protect the road. Back down in the valley, the route continues to the Motta hamlet and shortly thereafter to a bridge crossing the Verzasca river. The path now turns and follows the right side of the river. Mostly in the forest it continues, sometimes over a flight of steps, to Lavertezzo. The crystal-clear, emerald torrent flows through the valley, roaring and foaming at times, quiet and serene at others. The double-arched Ponte dei Salti shortly before the destination is a popular photo spot. The natural bathtubs created by erosion are often used for swimming – a perfect end before the return to the village."]},

Later, the Roman Road led from Rodi along the western side of the valley to Monte Piottino and finally down to Prato. The “Urner Saumweg” (mule track of Uri) was not built until the 16th century and led directly through the gorge. This is when the Dazio Grande customs house was built, because the gorge formed the border between Swiss and Milanese territory. For a long time Rodi consisted of only this one building for the transfer of goods. At the same time, it also served as a toll station and customs office. Today, the Dazio Grande is open to guests, offering a country-style restaurant, overnight accommodations and an exhibit about the gorge."]},

Braggio can be reached via the small self-service aerial cable car or on foot via the old mule path. Our itinerary takes us through the only flat plain of the Calanca valley, onwards to Selma, from where another detour via an antique footpath – or by means of another self-service cable car – leads us to the charming village of Landarenca at 1272m above sea level, on the right side of the Calancasca river. Back down at the valley floor, we continue hiking on the historic trail to Cauco, which until the end of the 18th century was a center of soapstone workmanship.

The village centre is characterised by old houses dating from the 17th to 19th centuries.

The location of the former sanatorium at 1141 m is amazing. It was built in 1890 and at that time it focused on tuberculosis patients. In 1961, it burned down and was replaced by a hotel with a restaurant which is popular with holiday guests and day visitors. This stage leads over a long mountain ridge past scattered farms and trees and across meadows with views of the valley of the Grosse Emme and the Bernese Alps towering in the background.

It was approximately 57 meters high when its crown was cut off by a storm in 1999. With today’s destination in sight, the Moosegg, you continue to descend about another 300 altitude meters to Emmenmatt. The trail continues past farms with elaborately piled wood stacks. Langnau in the Emmental Valley is known as the centre of the Emmental cheese. Its typical holes are even used in some idiomatic expressions, such as “full of holes like Swiss cheese,” referring to impractical rules, for example. In Emmenmatt you cross the Ilfis and the Grosse Emme rivers. The two are joining just a short while later to form the Emme.", "Now the trail climbs uphill for about 90 minutes to Moosegg.

From Poschiavo with its townscape of national importance, the first stage of the UNESCO world heritage route follows the Rhaetian railway. On the way to the Bernina pass at 2328 metres, you will see the Cavaglia glacier garden with its glacier mills and Alp Grüm, offering a first view of the eastern side of the Bernina massif. The pass itself not only represents the main European water divide between the Black Sea and the Adriatic, but also the border between the Rhaeto-Romanic and Italian language zones.

After Fuorcla Surlej, the wide path ends at the middle station Murtèl of the Corvatsch cable car. The last section is a downhill traverse along the mountain flank to Alp Prasüra. In the valley between the lakes of Silvaplana and Sils, you arrive at the culturally significant village of Sils with the well-known district of Sils Maria. Past the church of Sils Baselgia and now on the Via Engiadina, the route leads through Grevasalvas on the left side of the valley, where a Heidi film was shot in the 1970s.

The three elevations of the valley - each with its own appeal - can be explored on this tour.", "The starting point of the hike is the Crêt-du-Midi mountain ridge, just above the edge of the forest. To get there, take the gondola from Vercorin.
