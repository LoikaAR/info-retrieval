The festival was one of the first major cultural events in Montreux. Well-heeled winter spa guests and day-trippers would take home boxes full of daffodils. Such a thing would be unthinkable today because there are fewer daffodil meadows. Compared to the 1960s, there has been a 70-80% decrease; as a result, wildflowers are protected."]},

In the second half of the 19th century the road construction work opening up the Gasteretal began here and repairs were made at a later time. The section where the pass road was blasted out of the Chluse is particularly spectacular. Masonry parapets, drystone walling, edged stones, arched bridges, tunnels, a semi-gallery – all these structural masterpieces can still be seen today. Therefore, despite the motorised traffic, the experience is far more exciting on the original road than on the relatively unspectacular mule track.

The solitude and the gorgeous flowers growing in the Gasteretal are fascinating, especially in the spring. Even rarities, such as clematis or lady’s slippers can be spotted here.

It once was the private holiday residence of Sir Ernest Cassel, a super wealthy German-British banker. Refreshments in the tea salon of the Victorian villa are in order before walking down to Riederalp West. Illustrious guests, such as Winston Churchill, used to be frequent visitors to the villa. The historic building now houses the Pro Natura Centre Aletsch, both a nature conservation centre with guest accommodations and the gate to the Jungfrau-Aletsch UNESCO World Heritage site at the same time."]},

The hay was transported by hay bands. The points of impact can still be seen. The forest in the Verzasca Valley was used far into the 20th century for coal and timber production. When trees were cut, the slopes lost their hold. The forest where the path now leads had to be reforested to protect the road.

Later, the Roman Road led from Rodi along the western side of the valley to Monte Piottino and finally down to Prato. The “Urner Saumweg” (mule track of Uri) was not built until the 16th century and led directly through the gorge. This is when the Dazio Grande customs house was built, because the gorge formed the border between Swiss and Milanese territory. For a long time Rodi consisted of only this one building for the transfer of goods. At the same time, it also served as a toll station and customs office. Today, the Dazio Grande is open to guests, offering a country-style restaurant, overnight accommodations and an exhibit about the gorge."]},

From here, the stormy Simmen falls can not only be seen and heard, but also felt on one's own body in the form of water splashes. Here, masses of water cascade over the rocks and envelop the surroundings in mist. The bridge or dam in front of the waterfall serves as a barrier to divert the rising Simme. This measure was taken as early as the late 18th century to protect the valley from flooding. Barbara was the name of the wife of the Kurhaus director at the time, who made it possible to open up the Simmen falls and the barrage to tourists.

Before reaching Alp Rezlibergli, the terrain becomes somewhat more level, but the hike is all the more exhilarating as you detour to the seven springs of the Simme. At the foot of a mighty limestone wall, the Simme foams to the surface. In summer, up to 2800 litres per second flow from the seven springs. This fascinating natural spectacle and the surrounding mountain meadows with fireplaces invite you to linger. ", "The second ascent is another strenuous one.

Along the second leg of Via Gottardo, the focus is on railway history: Your first stop is at the Frenkenbrücke industrial monument, Switzerland’s oldest preserved railway bridge. In 2005, the last train crossed this 1854-built wrought-and-cast-iron truss bridge. At Altmarkt, known for its ancient crossing keeper’s hut, the rails of SBB and Waldenburger line separate. Nevertheless, Lausen plays a vital role in freight service. Here the route briefly leaves the valley bottom and climbs up to the reservoir. With views of the railway line, you reach Itingen and its compact row houses. ", "Less compact is the imposing, late-Baroque Ebenrain Castle at the entrance to Sissach. Built as a country estate by Basel-based silk manufacturer Martin Bachofen in 1774/75, it nowadays serves the Regierungsrat (cantonal government) as a venue for receptions. The park, courtyard and veranda are accessible to the public. At Sissach, the main SBB line Basel-Olten via the Hauenstein base tunnel separates from the old Hauenstein line, which will take centre stage for the rest of the hike. The old Hauenstein Tunnel is considered Switzerland’s first mountain tunnel and was even celebrated as the “fallen barrier of global transport” back in 1858. Various structures catch your eye along the route: embankments, bridges, retaining walls and tunnels. In addition to the Hauenstein summit tunnel itself, the viaduct near Rümlingen is particularly impressive. It is 128 metres long and consists of eight arches. This structure has often inspired artists such as Ferdinand Hodler. Under the viaduct, the route moves away from the railway line a second time. ", "After passing through Häfelfingen and along the forest edge, you can soon make out the ruins of Homburg Castle. It is accessible to the public, and the three-level fortified tower is imposing. The viewing platform offers sweeping views of the surrounding Jura mountains. Head downhill through the forest, and you’re almost at this leg’s final destination. During the walk you cannot fail to notice that the track is used by different train compositions: from the goods train up to the elegant high speed train.  At the stage places Liestal, Sissach and Läufelfingen there are special information boards which inform about the times of walk and the railway history."]},

At Restaurant le Theusseret, where the route turns and the climb begins, the famous trout is served with a view of the waterfall near the dam. Invigorated by the delicious meal, we climb up the mountain trail to the village of Chez-le-Bolé. This part in the forest is very steep and slippery and therefore secured with chains and a few short ladders. The Blanche-Eglise rock shelter should not be missed. The path continues at the foot of Les Sommêtres ridge. This place is quite popular with rock climbers. ", "At the end, there is an opportunity for a tour to the ruins of Spiegelberg castle. In the Middle Ages, a fortress was built on the razor-sharp ridge by the Lords of Spiegelberg. Because the drop of the hillsides is almost vertical, the fortress was believed to be unassailable at that time. Today a refuge hut is located at the same place. It’s a good idea to take a break up here: The Sommêtre ridge is one of the breeziest and most scenic spots in the Canton Jura with a marvellous view over the Doubs Valley, to France and of part of the Freiberge Mountains. On the return to the Le Noirmont train station, the trail passes the Crauloup forest cabin and the rehabilitation clinic Roc Montès. A stroll through the village is another highlight with the old church, now a cultural centre, and the modern architecture of the new church."]},

It is actually a fossilised coral reef, once submerged in the primeval Tethys Sea (200 million years ago) – as plenty of fossils attest. This is one of Switzerland's most famous climbing walls, spanning multiple rope lengths.", "You then hike uphill towards Anzeinde on mostly broad paths. If you listen carefully, you'll hear the marmots whistling as you arrive. Farmed since the 13th century, this Alpine meadow is located on a broad high plain above the tree line. From here, you have a stunning view of the steep rock faces beneath the glaciated Diablerets group of mountains. Look up to admire the Alpine view – and from here on, the hike itself becomes increasingly Alpine. It takes you to Col des Essets pass, which you cross. ", " ", "After descending through a valley to Alp La Vare, the route climbs again via Sur Champ to La Motte. You need to be sure-footed on this section, which is more challenging in a couple of places. On reaching the top, an enchanting view of the Rhone and Lake Geneva opens up. Then comes a somewhat steeper descent to Solalex, where the hike started. At one difficult point, the path is secured with chains but otherwise, the going is good. On returning, you've certainly earned a break: enjoy gazing for one last time at the sheer rock wall, still bathed in shadow."]}
