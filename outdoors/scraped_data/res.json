Alpine cheese is produced on the Obersee tableland that one can acquire straight from the source (except from July until mid-August, when the Alpine dwellers are on the upper Rauti tableland). Underway you come across numerous information boards and a playground with barbecue. But also at the end of the hike, on the terrace of the Obersee mountain restaurant, you can enjoy a refreshment with wonderful views of the lake."

On the way one experiences nature up close and also learns interesting details about wild-haymaking. This ancient tradition is still alive in Canton Uri: in laborious manual labor the peasants cut the grass on steep slopes, the so-called \u201cWildi\u201d. This way they ensure the cattle have enough feed for winter, while making an important contribution to preserve the bio-diversity in the Swiss mountain world. Visitors hear the strange hum of the wild-haymaking \u201czip line\u201d (a rope used for transporting the hay). They also see the towering \u201cTriste\u201d (hay bales attached to a pole) and enjoy the typical scents of the freshly mowed slopes."

            "The quiet resort of Kandersteg with a population of about 1000 is located at the foot of the L\u00f6tschen Pass. Sometimes directly along the Kander River, then at some distance from the water, the path meanders up to Eggeschwand. Near the Sunnb\u00fchl base station it dips into the Chluse ravine and then becomes steeper. The thundering of the Kander accompanies you on the climb up through the ravine. In the second half of the 19th century the road construction work opening up the Gasteretal began here and repairs were made at a later time. The section where the pass road was blasted out of the Chluse is particularly spectacular. Masonry parapets, drystone walling, edged stones, arched bridges, tunnels, a semi-gallery \u2013 all these structural masterpieces can still be seen today. Therefore, despite the motorised traffic, the experience is far more exciting on the original road than on the relatively unspectacular mule track. ",
            "The Chluse is followed by the floodplain of Gastereholz, surrounded by steep cliffs. The Schwarzbach and Geltibach rivers merge with the young Kander here. The latter dominates the high valley and meanders through the landscape joined by many tributaries. The path also continues to snake uphill through beautiful birch forests. The solitude and the gorgeous flowers growing in the Gasteretal are fascinating, especially in the spring. Even rarities, such as clematis or lady\u2019s slippers can be spotted here. While approaching the frequently snow-covered Sackhorn, it is well worth your while to take a look at the mountains behind you, Bunderchrinde Pass, for example, next to Chline Loner. The pass connects Kandersteg with Adelboden. ",
            "After the last bridge near Geissalmi the path zigzags to the paved road that later ends in the small settlement of Selden. This is the starting point of the highlight of this tour: the crossing of the L\u00f6tschen Pass. As the oldest mountain passage between the Valais and Bern it is very popular with hikers. The L\u00f6tschen Pass lost its importance as a mule trail when the easier Gemmi route was developed."

However, the watch crisis of the 1970s made it necessary to reorient the town. Today, energy technology and micromechanics also play important roles.

The trail then leads through a varied landscape, past glacier residue, waterfalls and meadows to your destination, the village of Samnaun."

Today Lake Uri\u2019s hotspot for surfing and kiting, it was once home to an explosives factory run by Al-fred Nobel. For centuries, the old road to Isenthal was the only route along the left bank. The trail leads from the village and into the Grosstal and to the chapel of St. Jacob. If you feel so inclined, you can try your hand at some of the old crafts at various stations along the way. The old cattle track leads up to Gitschenen and to the Betruf Chapel, an unconventional and emblematic building linked to the giving of traditional Alpine blessings and to the Golden Ring over Uri. This is a wild valley with a signif-icant amount of forest. In 2016, the Isenthal\u2019s wild hay expanses were named \u00abLandscape of the Year\u00bb by the Swiss Foundation for Landscape Conservation (SL).",
            "The Alpine mountain trail from Uri to Nidwalden and from Gitschenen to Klewenalp affords a sublime experience of nature. Its highlights include the highest point on the Via Urschweiz, the Hinterjochli, and the view far into the Swiss Mittelland. The silence here is impressive, and the natural environ-ment with its mountain flowers and wild animals is quite intoxicating. The trail also passes through Alpine meadows. 16 ponds and pools are home to many wetland plant species and the highest occur-rence of common toad and mountain newt. ",
            "The Klewenalp is a popular leisure area in both summer and winter and is accessible by using the longest cableway in Central Switzerland. Beckenried, at the foot of the Klewenalp, marks the end of the Via Urschweiz route from the Swiss Path to the Waldst\u00e4tter Trail."

The village was built on an alluvial plain between the Buochserhorn and the imposing panoramic B\u00fcrgenstock in the middle part of lake Lucerne. ",
            "After a good half hour along the lakeshore and another through residential neighbourhoods, you reach Beckenried. The holiday resort is located at the foot of the Klewenalp, the popular hiking region can be reached by cable car. After another thirty minutes, the Trans Swiss Trail separates from the Via Jacobi. While the latter climbs up to Emmetten and circles the pre-alpine mountain terrace, the Trans Swiss Trail continues to follow lake Lucerne to Risleten. Now you require more stamina: past the waterfall, the trail climbs a steep 200 metres to Haselholzboden. ",
            "The Via Jacobi rejoins the route at Haselholzboden. A fantastic, sometimes slightly exposed, but safe section now follows along the rocky ledge above lake Lucerne. While at Triglis, the Via Jacobi finally bids farewell heading towards the lake, the last hour of hiking continues along the road to Seelisberg. The holiday resort with a magnificent view of lake Lucerne and the two Mythen peaks is the destination of this almost six-hour hike."

            "Three lovely mountain lakes are located in a wetland area at the head of the Murg valley. The stage begins at the Murgsee hut surrounded by meadows and mountain peaks. Over rock-strewn terrain, the trail climbs steeply up to the Widersteinerfurgglen at an altitude of 2,013 metres. Here the view opens up over the Sernftal valley.",
            "The trail now heads downhill again through the rocky and steep Widersteiner Loch. Below B\u00fctzistock and Heustock, the southern slope is crossed on a high-level path with a magnificent view of the Glarus and Graub\u00fcnden alps. You descend on a narrow path and later on a solid gravel road in steady ups and downs and briefly pass the tree line. After the ski hut at an altitude of 1,759 metres, the trail heads uphill again. Below the path, the slope drops steeply and the M\u00fchlebach stream plunges deep down into the valley.",
            "After crossing the M\u00fchlebach stream, the trail continues uphill on a narrow path across lush meadows. There are more boulders in the pastures now as the highest point of the route approaches. The huge mountain formations are visible from here, and steep scree slopes and tiny mountain lakes fringe the path. On the Wissmeilen pass at an altitude of 2,416 metres, a magnificent panorama opens up from the Alvier to the Piz Sardona, the namesake of the World Natural Heritage Site.",
            "One of the most spectacular phenomena of the UNESCO World Heritage Tectonic Arena Sardona is the Glarus main overthrust. A line visible from afar, running horizontally through the mountain range, separates rocks up to 300 million years old from younger rocks. Far below the earth's surface at that time, the older rock layers have pushed onto the younger rock layers and today lie as peaks atop the mountain range. This and other geophenomena make the history of the formation of the mountains in this area tangible at first hand.",
            "Now the route continues downhill for another 470 metres to the destination of the stage. The trail leads past the Verrucano rock which is known for its great diversity in colour. The Madseeli lake invites you to take a refreshing dip before you reach the Spitzmeilen hut a little later. With the growing popularity of skiing, it was built next to a spring in 1903. Situated on the steep slope of the Fetschench\u00f6pf at an altitude of 2,087 metres, it offers a fantastic view over the Sargans region and as far as the Churfirsten peaks."

            "You then continue uphill over the Chatzenstrick and descend to Altmatt. Even from the heights of the Chatzenstrick you can see that the valley below is quite special. In autumn, the moor shimmers in brownish-red to golden colours. In the cool, humid climate of the plateau between Biberbrugg and Rothenthurm, high moors and shallow bogs have developed over thousands of years. When it rains, the peat mosses soak up the water like a sponge, and once the sun is back, they release the stored water into the environment. In this way, peatlands act as a natural flood protection. Since dead plant remains do not decompose due to the wet conditions, the carbon they contain is stored as peat for thousands of years and thus binds CO2.",

The 7.2 square kilometre lake was originally formed by a glacier. The Battle of Morgarten between the Confederates and the Habsburgs took place on its shores in 1315.

Due to persistent heavy rainfalls this slide buried 102 homes of the R\u00f6then and Goldau hamlets under about 400 million m3 of debris. It even reached the western shore of Lake Lauerz where it caused a flood wave. Overall, 457 people and over 320 animals lost their lives in the disastrous event.",

The climate in the plain increased the risk of malaria. Plus, Bellinzona was an embattled town back then and the valley was located in a strategic position for passing armies and soldiers. The elaborately restored village contains typical stone houses, vegetable gardens, terrace-like grain fields and vineyards. Dry stone walls and an old mule track were also renovated.

Depending on the area, the charming river is gentle and wild at the same time - a paradise for fishermen and canoeists. At the beginning, the route leads uphill via Les Hormets. At first still on a road, it soon changes to a lovely path running through pastures and along the edge of the forest. ",

Its basis are the fascinating natural and cultural landscapes of the Doubs valley and its plateaus with the extensive \"Wytweiden\" pastures. Here, woods and open grassland alternate like a mosaic. With the Doubs at your back, you now climb, sometimes steeply, through primeval forest sections and across dreamy pastures. Les Pommerats is reached after 400 metres of ascent. Once you arrive at the high plateau of the Franches-Montagnes, you enter a quiet countryside with dark forests, open pastures, old trees and scattered farms, surrounded by horses, cows and sheep. ",

The main town of the Franches Montagnes is famous for the March\u00e9-Concours, the national festival of the Franches-Montagnes horses, which takes place every year in August."

            "Its name might suggest otherwise, but the Toblerone Trail will appeal more to history-lovers than those with a sweet tooth. \"Toblerones\" was the popular name for the tank traps set up as defensive lines between Bassins and Nyon in the second world war. Their triangular shape recalls the \"peaks\" of a Toblerone chocolate bar, and that explains the name given to the 3,000 or so concrete triangles \u2013 each as tall as a man. The \"Toblerones\" are arrayed along a stretch of about ten kilometers between the Jura foothills and Lake Geneva. An educational trail focusing on history follows the traps.",
            "Around 1940, when German troops were attacking neutral countries such as Belgium and Norway, fears also reached very high levels in Switzerland. This prompted the start of construction work on the \"Promenthouse Defence Line\": chunks of concrete were set up one after another along the courses of rivers and streams. Instead of removing them again, some were restored as a reminder of the war's importance for Switzerland. But military history is only one interesting aspect of the hike along these \"Toblerones\". This is also a paradise for nature-lovers: the massive tank traps tend to prevent intensive cultivation of the land, so they are now wreathed in moss and ivy \u2013 a welcoming habitat for many plants and animals. Birds chirrup along the streams and above the canopy of greenery. From the fields, you can admire the views of Lake Geneva and the French Alps. ",
            "There are also some fascinating buildings along the way, such as the Villa Rose near Gland (a listed monument). This two-storey building is painted pale pink with green shutters. But Villa Rose is not a cosy home: in fact, it is an ingeniously designed fortress. The windows turn out to be fake, and even the toilet has disguised slits for shooting at the enemy! On reaching the shore of Lake Geneva, the route crosses the golf course of the Domaine Imp\u00e9rial club. There is an air of grandeur about the clubhouse here. No wonder: Napoleon's family once used it as a villa. The beach near Prangins brings this outing to an enchanting conclusion. A visit to the Swiss National Museum in Prangins Castle is also worthwhile \u2013 and, of course, a stroll through the pretty historic centre of Nyon, overlooked by the towers of Nyon castle."

            "Yvonand, located on Lake Neuchatel, is a popular summer destination thanks to its fine sandy beaches, otherwise rarely found in Switzerland. Fortunately, a strip of forest separates the village from the beach, making it a bit easier to resist the temptation of a refreshing dip. With the lake at the back, the start of this hike is rather unspectacular, leading on asphalt through residential areas. After the massive motorway viaduct, the surroundings begin to show their scenic side: an attractive trail winds along the Ruisseau des Vaux brook, lined with steep sandstone cliffs. Situated in a canyon, the nature reserve boasts a rugged beauty both on top of the cliffs and down in the gorge. With a bit of luck, you might even encounter native chamois. Whereas the Vallon des Vaux was covered mainly by oaks in the past, a tree revered by the Celts, beech trees and conifers are widespread today.",

The described route branches off to the left toward the tower of St-Martin. These ruins were part of the fortification, the only indication of a significant medieval settlement that has completely disappeared in the meantime. Built around the year 1240 and renovated in the 20th century, the tower once served as the residence of the lords. Today, an iron staircase leads to the top of the building, where stunning views over the Jura with its pastures and farmsteads await visitors.",
            "The following section leads slightly uphill to Ch\u00eane-Paquier. The local church, built in 1667, is one of the oldest witnesses of Protestant architecture in Switzerland. Its layout is remarkable: a conical roof with turrets rises above the church's elliptical shape. Before you head back, a visit to the lovely village with its farmhouses and the H\u00f4tel de Ville is worthwhile. Continuing across cultivated land with sweeping views over the Jura and the lake, your hike ends at the Yvonand railway station."

            "In the area of \u00abRevers des Ottans\u00bb there\u2019s a possibility to climb up to a former mine on a theme trail, where gold and arsenic used to be mined (extension of the hike of approx. 1 hour). The old mine is abandoned today and not open to visitors because it is unsecured and dangerous. Close to the entrance, however, an old rail wagon that transported rocks from the mine can still be visited. The rocks were then smashed and the extracted minerals were carried down into the valley by donkeys. From the area of \u00abRevers des Ottans\u00bb, the hiking trail leads around the lake and completes the loop before returning to the Vallon de Van down below."

Following this, a short descent then leads to Sattelboden: from where you have beautiful views of the Oberseetal valley opposite with its sparkling lake, the remarkable Br\u00fcnnelistock and diverse alpine operations.

Finally, you walk along the banks of the Venoge to the scattered village of Vufflens-la-Ville. After that, around two and a half hours further along the road, comes Bussigny.",

You reach St. Sulpice along the shore of Lake Geneva, and one and a half hours sees the end of this stage at Lausanne Ouchy. This final part represents an extreme contrast to the first five hours of hiking: it goes from dreamy, secluded, natural and quiet to fast-paced, hectic, modern and noisy."

            "The circular route begins in Murten itself. The fairy-tale town centre with its historic school, the impressive Berntor gate and  massive town walls temp you to linger in amazement. The circular route continues along the lakeside promenade, from where you can thoroughly enjoy the sight of the glistening waters and  surrounding vineyards.",
            "On an easy path, you step into a peaceful, intact region, which repeatedly captivates you with its natural beauty. After passing through a stretch of woodland, you reach the other side of the lake, where the route leads through the middle of extensive vineyards and constantly reveals picturesque stretches of land in the region.   ",

They were taken by surprise, leading to roughly one company's capture. Some Frenchmen managed to escape to Schwyz. Village priest Lukas Geisser recalls the events: After the French had been put to flight, two horsemen armed with spears, sabres, and a pistol headed up the hill towards him. Another 30 soldiers soon followed them. The officer leading them came up to him, opened his uniform jacket and showed him the large cross on his chest. In broken German, he said: \"We also good Christians, we enemies of the French, you also, we therefore friends.\"",

The river has formed gorges, some looking like canyons, and as it flows through the valley, it is gentle at times, wild at others.

This is followed by an almost endless but idyllic and varied forest path lined by an impressive array of giant anthills. The middle section is relatively steep and includes a few short passages along asphalted roads. About two hours later, after passing the Bonmont golf course and crossing expansive fields, we reach the small town of Nyon by Lake Geneva."

            "Firstly, along the Kl\u00f6ntalersee reservoir surrounded by steep rock faces. A decent to Glarus then follows - From the dam of the artificial lake through a narrow valley with steep rock faces and imposing boulders lapped by the bubbling L\u00f6ntsch waters.",
            "Hinter Kl\u00f6ntal, surrounded by mountains, is a delightful place at the upper end of Kl\u00f6ntal Lake. The natural lake at an altitude of 848 m is only three square kilometres in size and was formed by a landslide. The wetlands at the mouth of the River Kl\u00f6n are of national importance. A lovely path leads from Hinter Kl\u00f6ntal along the shore to Seer\u00fcti on the other side of the lake. Motorized traffic is not permitted on the first section of the road. The northern peaks of Mutteristock and Schijen, and M\u00fcrtschenstock to the east are mirrored in the smooth water. A variety of pleasant spots along the shore are perfect to grill your lunch and rest your feet. ",
            "Through the narrow rock passage near B\u00e4rentritt the path later leads to a group of rocks, which is called the Gessner memorial. It was created by nature and dedicated to Salomon Gessner (1730-1788), a poet and painter from Zurich, in 1788 by two admirers, although it is somewhat doubtful whether they really meant to honour Gessner or if they intended to immortalize themselves. Be that as it may \u2013 when the story was published in 1789, the Kl\u00f6ntal Valley gained instant fame. ",
            "The no-driving zone ends after the bridge and the path changes to a gravel road. Almost two hours have passed by the time you reach the small damn at the end of the lake. The damn has been used to generate electricity since 1908. Now the downhill section begins. The trail meanders along the L\u00f6ntsch down to Chohlgr\u00fcebli. After a canyon-like passage the landscape opens up near Staldengarten. Cross the Allmend to get back to civilization in and around Glarus, the smallest capital of all Swiss cantons. This rather short leg ends a little while later at the railway station."

It winds its way through the gloriously unspoilt forest, where Alpine roses and rare mountain flowers can be seen on the mossy ground. The route is lined with benches and little wooden bridges over the waterway. On the left above Alp \u00c4bnet is the entrance to the Eggeri channel. The trail leads back to Gr\u00e4chen via the Hohtschuggen lookout point with a magnificent view of the Bietschhorn and the Vispertal valley.

Coming out of the woods and passing through pristine farmland again, you reach Dagmersellen shortly after. Here, the parish church of St. Laurentius catches the eye. It was constructed 1818-22 with classicist, late baroque elements. You then pass a residential area and the two motorway entrances and exits before the route enters the forest again. By now, you have been on the move for over three hours. ",

At St. Erhard, the spectacular sights include the Pilatus and Rigi. Leave the high-altitude trail towards the railway station.

This way, hikers can better understand the geology, flora and fauna of the scenery they're passing through.",

Half-way through the loop you'll find the Cubly viewpoint, which takes in all these views to offer a 360\u00b0 panorama from the Jura to the Chablais, with Lake Geneva below.

On other parcels of land, they grow more densely. ",

Between 1897 and 1957, this was celebrated with a grandiose daffodil festival, which saw international orchestras performing and flower parades with decorated floats moving through the streets. The festival was one of the first major cultural events in Montreux. Well-heeled winter spa guests and day-trippers would take home boxes full of daffodils. Such a thing would be unthinkable today because there are fewer daffodil meadows. Compared to the 1960s, there has been a 70-80% decrease; as a result, wildflowers are protected."

            "The theme trail between Vallorbe, Ballaigues and the French village of Jougne explores the geography, history and present time of the cross-border industrial valley of La Jougnena. It follows an inoperative railway line and a former pilgrimage route. Information panels along the way explain the history of the trade and transport routes since Roman times as well as the development of crafts and iron smelting. Further information documents are available from the tourism office in Vallorbe.",
            "Surrounded by lush greenery, Vallorbe nestles on the banks of the Orbe river. The hike starts at the train station which is surprisingly large for a village with less than 4000 inhabitants. This is due to its historical importance: Vallorbe is a railway junction and an important border station. In 1915, the Mont d'Or tunnel was opened here on the Paris-Dijon-Vallorbe-Lausanne-Simplon-Milan line. The trains cross the Orbe river on the impressive Le Day railway viaduct which you pass along the hiking trail. Some 450 metres downstream, the Orbe is dammed by the Barrage du Day. Crossing the dam wall, the trail then continues to Ballaigues.    ",
            "A bit outside in the forest near Chez Barrat, you will discover a historical track (Roman road). In the middle of the 19th century, salt was transported from the French salt works to Bern and western Switzerland. After a short while you enter France on foot. The trail follows the river Jougnena which rises at the south-western end of the Aiguilles de Baulmes, flows into France and then back into Switzerland into the Orbe. Before arriving in Jougne, where you turn around, you pass the Saint-Maurice chapel. It is located on a former pilgrimage route between the abbey of Saint-Maurice in Valais and Burgundy. From Jougne, you follow a railway line that once connected Vallorbe at the foot of Mont d'Or and Dent de Vaulion with Pontarlier. Opened in 1875, it was damaged during the Second World War and gradually closed down. If you want to delve further into the industrial history of the region, you can visit the iron and railway museum back in Vallorbe."

            "The climb begins in the small village of Sur En. North of the hiking trail, more than 180 wood and stone figures are displayed deep in the forest. They were created by international and regional artists in connection with the annual sculptors\u2019 symposium in Sur En. ",

The path is about a meter wide and part of it runs below the projecting rock face. In some places it is secured with ropes and handrails. You also pass through two short, but unlit tunnels, high above the river. You must be surefooted here and have no fear of heights. As late as the 1970s, coffee and cigarettes were smuggled to the Italian South Tyrol on this trail.",
            "You continue on a path leading through broad Alpine pastures where the cattle is peacefully grazing. Numerous creeks are flowing through the high valley. Near the national border, at an altitude of about 2,300 m, you reach the Schlinig moorland with its clear mountain lakes. A bit below the Schlinig Pass is the cosy and welcoming Sesvenna Hut of the Alpine Club of South Tyrol. Two small mountain lakes and extensive meadows are located right next to the hut."

            "After about three hours or so, you reach the Torret electric power station. Years ago you could even find glassworks along the Doubs. They were built there because the wood from the area was utilised, but because of the steepness of the terrain, it could not be transported to the villages. For example, the glassworks of Blancheroche used approximately 100 cubic metres of wood per month. Because the glassmakers continued to relocate as soon as the fuel was used up in a particular area, the Neuch\u00e2tel authorities soon prohibited the operation of glassworks on their land. And soon, after walking more than five hours, the fascinating hike ends at Maison Monsieur."

While the water of the mineral spring is colourless, the iron dissolved in the water settles on the underground and provides a rusty red colour. Long ago, the Alpine herdsmen of the Diemtigtal Valley told their neighbours from the Simmental Valley about the healing powers of the Red Spring located all the way in the back of the Diemtigtal. The healing spring water was known far beyond the small mountain valley. For particularly serious illnesses, the water was picked up in barrels, jugs and bottles at the alp, even in winter and under very difficult circumstances. Because of the spring\u2019s healing powers Grimmialp became a health resort in the 19th century. For a few years, a water line was installed to transport the water directly from the spring to what was the Grimmialp sanatorium at that time.",

Remarkably, Suvorov ordered his exhausted and starving troops over the pass, given that the equipment, especially the footwear, had also been severely affected on the way to Altdorf. ",

            "Attraverso il bosco sopra il Doveria e la strada si procede verso valle sovrastati da imponenti pareti rocciose. Il sentiero di lastre in pietra piatte e levigate si intreccia con grandi massi mentre nella gola di Gondo costeggia imponenti pareti rocciose verticali.",

Oggi la torre ospita un hotel per conferenze e una mostra sulle miniere d\u2019oro della valle. La Via Stockalper termina qui a Gondo ma il percorso prosegue con altre due tappe fino a Domodossola. The stage starts at the Hotel Post in the village of Simplon, which is located at 31 kilometres from both Brig and Domodossola. Thanks to its lovely stone houses, the village has a somewhat Mediterranean character. Those who want to learn more about the history of the region and the natural surroundings can delve into the past at the Ecomuseum with its wooden ceilings and massive walls.",
            "You leave the village through narrow alleys and follow the mule track and the gorge of the Chrummbach to start the gentle descent to Gondo in the east. Enormous wooded slopes rise up on all sides.",
            "After crossing extensive pastures, there\u2019s a steep descent through the forest along nice stone steps. At the bottom, the Chrummbach stream flows into the Doveria, and the old mule track descends on the other side of the crest into the romantic Zwischbergen valley to Gondo. Past former gold mines, the trail continues along the northern slope towards the rocky Gondo gorge.  ",
            "Through the forest above the Doveria stream and the road, you hike further down into the valley underneath impressive rock faces. A trail made of flat, smooth slabs of stone winds its way between huge boulders. In the Gondo gorge, vertical rock faces line the path.",
            "Protected by the covered road, part of the trail passes beneath various watercourses which drop into the depths beside the path. Some of the trail follows the mule track of Kaspar Stockalper or the Napoleon road. Time and again you come across bridges and masonry pillars of this masterpiece of French road construction. The national road is the latest traffic route, and it had to conquer its place next to the existing ones.",
            "Both the Napoleonic old barracks and the Gondo fort from the First World War are testimonies to the strategic importance of the gorge. The old barracks is linked to the Stockalperweg by a metal footbridge over the Doveria stream and today serves as a rest area for the national road. The Gondo fort includes a tunnel which is some 350 metres long and which the hike passes through.",
            "The border village of Gondo is situated at the end of the gorge and at the same time at the exit of the Zwischbergen valley. The village is dominated by the Stockalper tower. On 14 October 2000, a landslide claimed thirteen lives in Gondo and destroyed numerous buildings. Today, the tower is home to a seminar hotel and an exhibition about the valley\u2019s gold mines. Here, the Via Stockalper ends. However, the route continues on two more stages to Domodossola."

From the middle of the 17th century, monks kept the big mountain dogs as guards and companions. They were also used to rescue and accompany people who had lost their way. The most famous of the dogs was called Barry, and he is said to have saved more than forty lives.",

On its north side, a tilted penitence cross sticks in the ground \u2013 the only one of its kind in the region.

The next destination is the beautifully situated Lehnkapelle. After the village of Sammelplatz you soon come to the romantic Waldkapelle St. Ottilia (Forest Chapel of St. Ottilia). St. Ottilia is the patroness of good eyesight. To this day, worshippers come here to scoop water from the fountain, hoping to cure their eye conditions. Above this chapel towers the Alpstein in all its glory and with this view the trail now heads downwards via meadow paths to Steinegg. ",
            "There you will find the Ch\u00e4smoos-Kapelle with its precious wooden crucifix. Before you follow the Sitter back to Appenzell, you reach the Kapelle St. Magdalena in Steinegg. The ceiling paintings are the work of famous artist Johannes Hugentobler, who also painted many of the colourful houses in the village centre of Appenzell. Soon the St. Anna-Kapelle comes into view, one of the most beautiful rococo chapels in Innerrhoden. Continue to follow the Sitter until the Lourdes-Kapelle greets you on the right on a small hill by the former indoor swimming pool. It is the last chapel on this circular trail, which ends back in Appenzell."

            "If you walk from Romoos through the multilayered Napf area, you might suddenly smell smoke or see mysterious wisps rising from between the trees. Not to worry, it is not a forest fire. It is just the fumes of the smoldering charcoal kilns. The charburners of Romoos are building conical piles of different kinds of wood. Then they light them to generate charcoal. They monitor the process around the clock for a good two weeks. The production of \u201cblack gold\u201d is hard work. ",
            "For centuries the farmers have been producing charcoal as a secondary income. Romoos once had around 200 charburning places because blacksmiths, iron foundries and glassworks needed a great deal of charcoal then. Nowadays, the ancient craft is practiced by just a few farmers from the Napf area. They still produce as much as 100 tons every year. Making air holes, adding burnable material, extracting charcoal \u2013 with a bit of luck, you might be able to peek over the workers\u2019 shoulders on the hike between Romoos and Bramboden. Signs along the way also provide information about the charburning craft, about gold prospectors and about natural phenomena in the region. ",

It passes steep cliffs and waterfalls, snakes through narrow ravines and climbs over sunny ridges. The area around Romoos is often compared to the Centovalli in the Ticino because of the similar topography. Bramboden, a place of pilgrimage, is a veritable gem. It is located in a side valley of the Entlebuch, far from any other village. A visit to the lovely mountain church, dedicated to St. Antonius of Padua, should not be missed, and the Pilgerbeizli restaurant is a perfect place to end the day."

A pleasant trail with benches and picnic areas leads along the river. At the reservoir, the rivers Toleure and Sandoleyre join the Aubonne.  ",
            "Once past the reservoir, botany enthusiasts can rejoice: above the vineyards of La C\u00f4te, a 200-hectare arboretum featuring more than 3,000 plant species from around the world awaits them. Marvel at over 200 maple species, oaks, magnolias, rosebushes, wetlands and Japanese katsura trees; they live up to their name in autumn, smelling of gingerbread and caramel. The tree and bush garden, created in 1968, is being managed by volunteers. You can choose between several circular paths with information panels. The arboretum is a delight for the eyes and nose and contributes to the conservation of species. The site includes an orchard with ancient varieties and a beautiful collection of apple trees and rosehip bushes. There's also a visitors' centre and a wood museum. ",
            "You eventually leave the arboretum in the direction of Saint-Livres. Coming out of the forest, enjoy splendid views of Aubonne and its round, white tower proudly overlooking the medieval town. The castle is a tribute to former Baron Jean-Baptiste Tavernier and his travels to the Orient. Next, the route branches off to the left and passes through Saint-Livres. The place takes its name from Saint-Lib\u00e8re (Liberius), Pope from 352 until 366, to whom the first church was dedicated. ",
            "Leading across fields and vineyards and affording magnificent views of Lake Geneva, the hike ends at Yens. The village sits on a ridge above the valley of the Boiron river. From here, take the train back to Morges."

After a fantastic, partly exposed, yet also safe stretch, you reach the Haselholzboden via a rocky outcrop. While the Trans Swiss Trail route continues downhill from here, the Via Jacobi route ascends to Emmeten. The village, at 774 metres above sea level, is a good starting point for activities in the Niederbauen, Stockh\u00fctte and Klewenalp area.",
            "After about four hours of hiking, a steep, approximately 400-metre descent begins. A path and stairs lead to R\u00fctenen, where the national routes converge again. Continuing along the lakeshore, you soon reach the holiday resort of Beckenried at the foot of Klewenalp. ",
            "Hiking mainly along the lakeshore and sometimes through residential areas, you reach Buochs after more than six hours. The village lies in an alluvial plain between the local Buochserhorn mountain and the better-known B\u00fcrgenstock on the western basin of Lake Lucerne. ",
            "After just under two more hours, you reach your destination in Stans. The physically demanding, eight-hour hike ends on the village square. People settled in this beautiful spot as early as two hundred years before Jesus-Christ."

            "Monte San Giorgio is located between Lake Lugano\u2019s southern arms. The route starts to climb in Tremona and first stops at the archaeological finds in Tremona-Castello. The remains of a settlement allow a detailed re-enactment of life in a farming village in the Middle Ages and can be explored with 3D-glasses. Meride is reached later at 586 m. Its narrow winding lanes, antique buildings and lovely courtyards are under landmark protection. The museum, designed by famous Ticino architect Mario Botta, has 230 million year-old fossils from Monte San Giorgio on exhibit. The area around the mountain was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003 because it has the world\u2019s best marine fossil record from the Triassic Period (230 to 245 million years ago). ",
            "Not far from the museum is the observation terrace of Val Mara. Within sight of the striking limestone cliff it offers insight into the prehistoric marine deposits and fossils. The route continues up toward Monte San Giorgio at 1000 m. First on a broad mule track shaded by dense forest, then on a relatively flat trail we arrive in Cassina and its chapel. The last part to the top is quite steep, but worth the effort. The view across the Ticino Alps and Lake Lugano is awesome. In bad weather, the San Giorgio church offers shelter. An enjoyable refuge at Alpe di Brusino is reached by a steep forest path. The grotto on the alp serves typical regional specialities in a lovely ambiance from April to October, surrounded by ancient chestnut trees. ",
            "From Serpiano a comfortable cableway goes down to Brusino Arsizio on Lake Lugano. The path leads to Hotel Serpiano and to the San Cristoforo church. A few steps from the hotel in the former customs house is the small studio of landscape painter Fiorello Fiorini, exhibiting paintings in addition to chairs that the artist revived. First through the forest, the path then leads to a road near Crocifisso. Across the road, a broad trail returns to the starting point through meadows and forest."

In 2005, the last train crossed this 1854-built wrought-and-cast-iron truss bridge. At Altmarkt, known for its ancient crossing keeper\u2019s hut, the rails of SBB and Waldenburger line separate. Nevertheless, Lausen plays a vital role in freight service. Here the route briefly leaves the valley bottom and climbs up to the reservoir. With views of the railway line, you reach Itingen and its compact row houses. ",

The park, courtyard and veranda are accessible to the public. At Sissach, the main SBB line Basel-Olten via the Hauenstein base tunnel separates from the old Hauenstein line, which will take centre stage for the rest of the hike.

Various structures catch your eye along the route: embankments, bridges, retaining walls and tunnels. In addition to the Hauenstein summit tunnel itself, the viaduct near R\u00fcmlingen is particularly impressive. It is 128 metres long and consists of eight arches.

After descending to the Sense, you cross the last covered wooden bridge in the city. The Bern Bridge was sawn up during an attack by the Bernese in 1340 to cut off the enemy's way.

As early as 1784, its wooden shingle roof was hit by a bullet, after which half the church burnt down again. The Entemoos and Rotmoos upland moors are part of the municipality. Peat used to be cut from the two nature reserves.",

Shortly before the end of the stage, you reach the border to the Gantrisch Nature Park, where biodiversity and darkness are promoted in addition to nature experiences. Arriving in Plaffeien, the largest neo-Romanesque church in the canton catches the eye. The lively town is considered the economic centre of the Sense Oberland."

The dual castle was the home of the most successful family in the Aargau region which, after rising in the late Middle Ages, went on to rule an empire with huge estates in Europe and colonies in America, Asia and Africa. As we leave the Raiwald forest and arrive in Brugg, a long and historic hike comes to an end. It's worth making a small detour here to see the nearby former K\u00f6nigsfelden Monastery."

Shortly before the end of the gorge we come to a huge erratic boulder, Alexander's Stone, a large sandstone rock from the Ice Age. There is also a boulder garden with 65 other imposing stones which were gathered from the surrounding area."

The stork village of Altreu, which at times is home to over 100 storks, is clearly visible during the hike.

Mother Nature is also part of the scenery: while the roar of an engine might occasionally disturb the peace, you will also hear marmots whistling nearby and if you pay attention, you\u2019ll even see a few away from the road.",
            "The upper part of the route is all about the old road and the muleteers, but the second section represents a different time. You see the Gotthard highway down in the valley and the new road across the pass. Crossing under a viaduct brings the former Motto Bartola defence structure into view, now a Swiss Army base. A narrow mountain trail leads past it and continues through meadows and short forest areas. The last section of the path down to Airolo offers a fantastic view of the Leventina Valley and the surrounding mountains. The trail passes through the lovely old town centre with its winding lanes and heads for the train station below. Airolo is a crossroads of traffic routes from different eras: the old 13th century mule track, the old railway tunnel which opened in 1882 and the Gotthard road tunnel, built approximately 100 years later. A monument by artist Vincenzo Vela near the train station honours the workmen who died during the construction of the railway tunnel."

Chasselas and Pinot Noir are the most important grape varieties in the area. But Merlot, Chardonnay and Gamaret are also grown here. The panoramic view over the plain and the alps in the background is unparalleled.",
            "After the small village of Sugiez, you hike through the magnificent lakeside forest of the Chablais region. On the way to Murten, the wildlife on the shores of lake Murten can be observed from the numerous observation towers. Upon arrival in the medieval town, the varied and delightful hike comes to an end. Situated on a hill above lake Murten, this pretty town has largely preserved its original appearance with its picturesque alleys, historic town centre, town wall and charming arcades."

From here, the stormy Simmen falls can not only be seen and heard, but also felt on one's own body in the form of water splashes. Here, masses of water cascade over the rocks and envelop the surroundings in mist. The bridge or dam in front of the waterfall serves as a barrier to divert the rising Simme. This measure was taken as early as the late 18th century to protect the valley from flooding. Barbara was the name of the wife of the Kurhaus director at the time, who made it possible to open up the Simmen falls and the barrage to tourists. ",

Before reaching Alp Rezlibergli, the terrain becomes somewhat more level, but the hike is all the more exhilarating as you detour to the seven springs of the Simme. At the foot of a mighty limestone wall, the Simme foams to the surface. In summer, up to 2800 litres per second flow from the seven springs. This fascinating natural spectacle and the surrounding mountain meadows with fireplaces invite you to linger. ",

The Les Foll\u00e9s passage where the channel follows the rocky ridge is not for the faint-hearted. It is not recommended for anyone who suffers from vertigo.

The incredible work of our forefathers is particularly striking here. They built the conduit on the mountainside with their bare hands, just a narrow channel made of boards and hugging the rocks. It was replaced in 1831 with a 95-m tunnel through which the water now flows. In 2019 the old channel was memorialised on the Swiss 100-franc bill and now the meaning is mostly sentimental. Still, this passage is head-spinning because there is a hole in the middle of the tunnel leading to a platform. The entire structure outside of the mountain can be clearly seen from there and it makes us understand the dangers to which the builders were exposed.

With its wild shore full of stones and tree trunks, it is popular with landscape photographers. How did it get its incredible colour? Legend has it that a rock spirit is reflected in the water. The princess had to find him, because only then would she be allowed to marry the prince. Her patience paid off: when the spirit showed itself, she threw a few blue flowers into the water. As a result, the lake took on their colour - and has retained it to this day. ",

            "After staying overnight in the middle of the World Natural Heritage Tectonic Arena Sardona, you hike through an unspoilt mountain landscape to the Foopass, accompanied by the Glarner main thrust fault on Foostock. The descent leads to Elm, facing a wonderful Glarner panorama.",
            "The stage starts at the end of the virtually uninhabited Calfeisen valley with a splendid view over the valley floor and the Gigerwald lake. The first section of the route leads along the steep slope back to the Heub\u00fctzli pass. The trail climbs far above the tree line over alpine meadows, scree gullies, streams and past rock faces. With a bit of luck, you can observe a family of marmots.",
            "Once on the pass, you look down on the Heub\u00fctzli lake, situated in a scree hollow. A narrow, pointed, rocky ridge stretches out to the left and right. The trail now continues partly on the mountain ridge around the Fahnenstock and then down into the Muota valley. Here it is quite possible to be observed by ibexes (or vice versa). Their majestic silhouettes stand out impressively against the Muota valley ridge.",
            "Numerous rocks have tumbled onto the meadows from the steep slopes on both sides. The special formations of terrain and rocks are a witness to the forces of nature that have been at work here over millions of years. Upon arrival at the Foobach rushing through deeply cut rock hollows, the descent ends and the route heads uphill once more.",
            "Passing picturesque rock faces in the green countryside, the trail now heads towards the Foo pass. Above the Heidelbach stream, you will notice a great variety of flora. Once on top of the Foo pass, the view opens up over the massive mountain ranges of the Sernftal valley. Here you reach the highest point of the stage at 2,223 metres and begin a long descent down to Elm with its 1,041 metres above sea level.",
            "Initially, the trail is steep and zigzags across stony slopes to Raminer Matt. Later it continues down into the valley on firmer paths through the forest. Here, one\u2019s attention is drawn time and again to the impressive waterfalls tumbling from the cliffs on the opposite side of the slope.",
            "During the descent, the main Glarus overthrust between Ringelspitz and Piz Sardona becomes clearly visible. The distinct horizontal line in the mountain separates two layers of rock. The supporting lower layer is more than 200 million years younger than the darker layer above.",
            "Once at the bottom of the valley, the trail continues across the Sernf river to Elm. From here it is well worth taking a look back at the mountain scenery and the Martinsloch (Martin's hole). Twice a year, the sun shines through this drop-shaped opening to illuminate the church tower of Elm. The hole is said to have been cut into the rock in the battle between the heroic Martin and the evil giant.",
            "In the slate museum in Elm, you can learn more about slate mining which marked this valley, and the production site of Elmer Citro offers a first-hand experience of the springs. You can descend into the spring area and learn how mineral water is generated from rain and snow deep in the Glarus mountains over the course of eight years."

It leaves Lake Lucerne as a wide river with many bends and joins the Aare River at Windisch (330 metres above sea level) in the Canton of Aargau.

A good level of fitness is a prerequisite for this 160-kilometre multiple day tour.

On the way past Silvaplana and St. Moritz, the gleaming glaciers of the nearby Bernina group are an impressive backdrop. The numerous cable cars in the area bear witness to the long history of the winter sports resort.

Here you can admire stately patrician houses as well as traditional dwellings with bay windows and elaborately painted facades. ",

            "This is an easy hike, following one of the many paths of the so-called pastoral migration. Humans and animals kept moving around, depending on the season, always in search of water. The loop trail explores the sophisticated antique irrigation system and ends with the emerald green waters of the Verzasca river.",
            "Thinking of Lavertezzo and the Verzasca Valley conjures up the arched stone bridge spanning the emerald green river. Images of natural swimming pools and an enticing dip arise. It\u2019s hard to believe that this valley once suffered a water shortage. But this is how it was. The old irrigation system with its catch basins, carved into the rocks, is what the easy loop hike along the Verzasca river is all about. ",
            "The trail starts near the church of Lavertezzo and climbs up to Sambugaro. Part of it follows the paths of the travelling farmers. These paths were used by semi-nomadic herdsmen to take the cattle to different summer pastures. The huts of Rev\u00f6ira, consisting of five settlement centres, and Ca d D\u00e9nt were inhabited in spring and fall. Some elements of the old irrigation system are seen here. Visible on the entire slope are 35 hollowed out, vat-like granite blocks holding about 4800 litres of rainwater. Six cisterns collected the groundwater to provide the \u201cblue gold\u201d to households and cattle. ",
            "Looking at the steep slopes above the pastures it is difficult to imagine how the grass was cut here. The hay was transported by hay bands. The points of impact can still be seen. The forest in the Verzasca Valley was used far into the 20th century for coal and timber production. When trees were cut, the slopes lost their hold. The forest where the path now leads had to be reforested to protect the road. Back down in the valley, the route continues to the Motta hamlet and shortly thereafter to a bridge crossing the Verzasca river. The path now turns and follows the right side of the river. Mostly in the forest it continues, sometimes over a flight of steps, to Lavertezzo. The crystal-clear, emerald torrent flows through the valley, roaring and foaming at times, quiet and serene at others. The double-arched Ponte dei Salti shortly before the destination is a popular photo spot. The natural bathtubs created by erosion are often used for swimming \u2013 a perfect end before the return to the village."

This stage of the Sound Trail is home to sound stations with a wide range of metallic tones and sound patterns.",

Of course, the sound sculptures are a constant invitation to visitors to relax for a while. Even after arriving at Iltios upper station, many visitors will leave this place with a lasting melody in their ear."

From Chalet de la Dent de Vaulion, the eponymous peak (1,483 metres above sea level) is easily and quickly accessible. The slopes of Dent de Vaulion are mainly covered with pine forest. In contrast, the summit features the sparse grassy vegetation of the Haut-Jura. A marvellous vantage point offers panoramic views over up to eight lakes in good weather, including Lakes Neuch\u00e2tel, Biel, Murten and Geneva, three lakes in the valley and Lac de Rousses in neighbouring France.

The Petra F\u00e9lix of the border brigade 1, which existed 1938-1994, is of national importance and lies west of the Mollendruz pass. It served as a checkpoint for the road from Le Pont and Vallorbe at the turn off to Vaulion-Romainm\u00f4tier and L\u2019Isle-Cossonay.

            " From the bus stop \"Abzweigung Schwarzhorn,\" approx. 2 km beyond the crest of the pass, the mountain trail ascends to Schwarzhornfurgga (2880 meters) and leads via the southern ridge to the peak. Thanks to the fantastic view and the fairly short ascent, the Schwarzhorn is a very popular climbing destination. There is hardly a more beautiful place to experience the sunrise. You can see a plethora of wonderful peaks in a sweeping view extending from Grossglockner to Mont Blanc."

For those hiking from the top of the pass towards Handegg, the best choice is the Kristallweg \u2013 following in the footsteps of the mules. It passes the new visitor centre at the hospice and the entrance to the Gerstenegg crystal cavern, which can only be visited on an official tour.",

The next astounding spectacle is not very far away: those seeking a nine-minute thrill can take the steepest funicular railway in Europe and chug up almost vertically through the fascinating Alpine panorama to Lake Gelmer in this rail convertible."

The \u201cUrner Saumweg\u201d (mule track of Uri) was not built until the 16th century and led directly through the gorge. This is when the Dazio Grande customs house was built, because the gorge formed the border between Swiss and Milanese territory. For a long time Rodi consisted of only this one building for the transfer of goods. At the same time, it also served as a toll station and customs office.

            "High above the Lungernsee lake, passing quaint alp chapels, the path climbs to \u00c4lggialp and the geographical centre of Switzerland. Over a rock barrier to the lake plateau of Melchsee-Frutt at a lofty altitude, goal of rest and recreation seekers in summer and winter.",
            "Br\u00fcnig Pass, known for the famous Swiss wrestling competition, connects Central Switzerland with the Bernese Oberland. With an altitude of just 1002 m the pass is open all year and popular with motorcycle riders. This stage begins at the cogwheel railway station and requires a bit of stamina. Accompanied by blossoming Alpine meadows, a view of sparkling Lake Lungern and all the way to the mountains of the Bernese Oberland, it takes about three hours to reach H\u00fcttstett. The first ascent of this stage is now behind you and the path begins to go down to the Melchtal Valley. Across Alp Chrummelbach with its lovely Alpine chapel and over the Small Melchaa, the trail continues on the other side of the valley through forests and meadows and leads up to the central point of Switzerland. By now you have been hiking for about five hours. ",
            "The geographic centre of Switzerland was established in 1988 at \u00c4lggi-Alp using the latest measuring technology, i.e. a triangulation pyramid. At that time, Switzerland\u2019s Federal Office of Topology celebrated its 150-year anniversary. A stone wall in the shape of Switzerland was constructed around the centre. The country\u2019s exact geographic centre is actually located further to the southeast, but because it is not easily accessible right above a rocky cliff, the location was shifted by about 500 meters. Seefeld Lake is reached from the peaceful mountain in about an hour. Nestled between Seefeldstock and Haupt the popular fishing lake is a perfect place to rest one\u2019s feet. ",
            "A sharp ascent follows immediately after the lake, first to Chringengr\u00e4tli with a fantastic view of Eiger, Schreckhorn and other peaks. From then on the path is secured with chains and ladders and leads through the rocks up to the Abgsch\u00fctz mountain shelter, the highest point of today\u2019s tour at 2228 m. The view from Mt. Pilatus all the way to Mt. Titlis is a fair reward for the arduous climb. While enjoying the sight of the surrounding peaks with Melchsee and Tannensee lakes and past Blausee lake, today\u2019s destination of Melchsee-Frutt is reached about an hour later. Cars are banned in this family-friendly village situated directly on Melchsee, which is teeming with trout. In the summer, the mountain valley looks like an awesome sea of flowers."

            "Fl\u00fcelen is located on the shore of Lake Uri under the steep forested hillside of the Eggberge. The former church is now used in a variety of ways and houses a rock crystal exhibition. Rudenz Castle, with its castle park that is open to the public, also invites you to linger. In the south of Fl\u00fcelen lies the natural paradise of the Reuss Delta, which is alluring with its flat moors, reed meadows and bathing islands.",
            "Between the train station and the landing stage, where steamboats dock regularly, is the start of the hike along the shore of the lake in a northerly direction. The cantons gifted the Swiss Path to the population of Switzerland in 1991. The cantons of Schaffhausen, the two Appenzells and St. Gallen were allowed to design this section of the trail in the order in which they joined the Swiss Confederation.",
            "A wooden bench shaped like a deck chair invites you to relax. Screeching seagulls, honking ships and the warm Foehn wind ensure a holiday mood. The train sounds remind you of the presence of the important north-south axis from Zurich to Milan, which runs parallel to long stretches of the route.",
            "On the lake promenade, you can walk comfortably along the hillside between the tracks and water. A narrow wooden footbridge goes underneath the Sulzegg viaduct. You are fast approaching the spectacular section on the rock faces of the Axenflue. The path was built into and through the rock and it provides a vertical view downwards from the old Axenstrasse onto the rock face to the azure blue Lake Uri and the surrounding mountains.",
            "The narrow paths are well maintained, and incorporate disused railway sleepers that serve as steps. Huge rock arches and pillars support the mountain under which the hikers pass, and they give you an idea of the effort involved in building the old Axenstrasse. Before this was opened in 1865, the important north-south traffic between Brunnen and Fl\u00fcelen had to be loaded onto ships.",
            "Now comes the descent back to the lake shore. Eighty steps above the Tell\u2019s Chapel, the Swiss chocolate industry has created the largest glockenspiel in Switzerland. During the day, one of around twenty melodies is played for the first few minutes of every hour. Further down on the lake shore, Wilhelm Tell is said to have escaped by jumping out of the bailiff Gessler's boat to the Tellsplatte to save himself. Four frescoes in the chapel depict the R\u00fctli oath, the shooting of the apple, Tell\u2019s leap and Gessler\u2019s death in the Hohle Gasse.",
            "A stunning trail follows the shore past the Tellsplatte. Beneath gnarled pine trees and past steep cliffs, you pass by several attractive places rest. Sometimes the trail is right next to the water, with small waves engulfing the large boulders beneath them. You reach Sisikon via winding steps and with a wonderful view of the surrounding mountains. The valley station of the Tw\u00e4rr\u00fcti-Buggialp cable car is above Sisikon. It offers a panoramic journey with a view over Lake Lucerne to the Rigi and the Pilatus."

It is the highest village on Napf Mountain and a former climatic health resort. From the mountain village in Lucerne\u2019s backcountry you have a fantastic panoramic view over the lovely hills of the Emmental region.

            "Menzberg with its distinguished church is located approximately halfway through today\u2019s stage. Soon after you reach the forest preserve. The natural, barely used forests provide an important refuge for rare plants and animals. After the Chroth\u00fctte hut, the hike becomes challenging again: The ascent through Chrachegrabe to Hapfigchnubel is exhausting. Luckily, the trees keep you in the shade and offer some cooling. The route continues mostly on wide country lanes and forest roads, but it rises steadily via St\u00e4chelegg up to Napf Mountain at 1408 m, the end of today\u2019s walk. ",
            "On the highest observation point between the Emmental and Entlebuch valleys you have an unobstructed panoramic view of the backcountry of Lucerne, the Emmental and the Mittelland region. At night you can see the lights twinkling from Jungfraujoch, Stockhorn and Weissenstein on the front range of the Jura Mountains. Napf Mountain consists primarily of conglomerate rock. A valuable consequence is the Napf gold. The region is still the centre for nugget gold. Panning for gold in the streams of the Napf is an experience offered by a variety of organisers."

Probably the most beautiful view over the UNESCO listed old town, which is encircled by the river Aare, is offered from the raised rose garden above the B\u00e4rengraben or from the platform of the 101-metre-high M\u00fcnster tower.

The wooden Auguet bridge was built in 1836 and used to be in Hunziken until 1974. Since the bridge there as part of the Rubigen - Belp connection was replaced with a concrete bridge, this bridge could be put to use to connect Muri and Belp. And so the former Hunziken bridge became the popular Auguet bridge. After about two hours, the hiking trail branches off to the left and leaves the bank of the Aare. Crossing the motorway, you reach Allmendigen b. Bern. The extensive farmland offers a pretty contrast to the alpine chain behind.

To the south the 4000-metre peaks of Valais. On the gentle descent to the M\u00e4rjelensee lake, cotton grasses and small tarns contrast with the rock and ice.",
            "While the tour starts at a sophisticated site, the Villa Cassel on Riederfurka doesn\u2019t look like it belongs to this pristine environment. The castle-like structure was built around 1900 by Ernest Cassel, a wealthy English banker. Today it houses the Pro Natura Centre Aletsch. From here you first walk along Mor\u00e4nenweg on the border of the Aletsch Forest. The views of the Aletsch Glacier from H\u00e4rdernagrat Ridge are absolutely breathtaking. At over 22 km it is still the longest glacier in the Alps, but it is getting about 50 m shorter every year. The Jungfrau-Aletsch arena was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001. ",
            "A fantastic view of the Oberaletsch Glacier, the second-largest glacier in the Aletsch area, opens up between Sparrhorn and Fussh\u00f6rner mountains. The path leading to the Moosfluh cable car station is bordered by grasses and small shrubs. The long-range views of the glacier in the north and the 4000 m peaks of the Valais in the south, including the Dom and the Matterhorn, are amazing. This lovely hike passes a few small lakes and crosses fields of cotton grass and it feels like being on wheels.",
            "After a somewhat steeper ascent to Hohbalm the path turns left, always following the Aletsch Glacier and offering unforgettable sights. Shortly before the M\u00e4rjelensee lakes, Jungfraujoch and Monk Mountain appear far in the distance. The small lakes are located in a depression between Eggishorn and Strahlhorn. M\u00e4rjelensee, now also known as Hintersee, formed in the 19th century. At that time it was as much as 1.6 km long. Today, it barely measures 100 m. Every year, the lake reforms over a period of several days and then empties out through an underground channel. The tour ends a short while later at the larger of the M\u00e4rjelensee lakes and the Gletscherstube mountain hut."

The eye wanders over the crevices and up to the L\u00f6tschenl\u00fccke pass in one direction and down over the entire L\u00f6tschental in the other.",
            "In the second part of the hike, the trail runs steeply downhill to the Lonza, the valley\u2019s main river, with glorious views of the Lang Glacier. On the other side of the valley, a path finally winds its way back to Fafleralp. Tip: this tour is also recommended in the opposite direction."

The trail continues to Seewen through the unrivalled landscape of the Gampen Plateau and its tower vantage point.",
            "Dornach is located at the gates of Basel in the Birs Valley, but it is part of the Canton Solothurn. What a way to start this first stage. It has barely begun and here you are looking at the cathedral of Arlesheim. The Roman Catholic church is the landmark of the village and a prominent work of Baroque architecture and interior design. The Arlesheim cathedral was built in 1680/81 and is one of the first major Early Baroque church buildings in Switzerland. A few minutes later you pass Ermitage Arlesheim, the largest landscaped English gardens in Switzerland. A visit is well worth it. Otherwise you will miss the beautiful gardens and the lakes, as they are hidden by the leaves on the trees. ",
            "Via a wide forest road the trail leads further uphill to Sch\u00f6nmatt and to the hamlet of Stollenh\u00e4user before it returns to the forest. After passing Munimatt you will soon get to the Gempenturm observation tower and Schartenflue Mountain. These form the distinctive edge of the Gempen plateau in the west. In good weather, the observation tower offers a fantastic panorama of the Vosges Mountains, in the direction of the Black Forest and the Swiss Alps. A restaurant is available immediately next to the tower. ",
            "Another path takes you to Gempen from here. Once past the small village you reach the Gempen plateau. This Table Jura plateau is located at an altitude between 600 and 700 m and belongs to the Canton Solothurn. It takes almost an hour to cross it, past meadows and through lovely forest sections, leaving the last buildings of Hochwald village behind. About a half hour later, after more meadows and pastures, the walk ends in Seewen. The town is located in the area where the High Chain Jura changes to the Table Jura and it is known for the Museum of Music Automatons. The church, situated on a promontory above the village, is visible from far away."

With an ingenious canal system, it was possible to lower the water levels of Lakes Murten, Neuch\u00e2tel and Biel.

Less than four kilometres farther west is the former abbey of Bellelay, where the T\u00eate de Moine was developed in the 12th century. After about one and a half hours, you reach Sornetan, a small village around 100 metres above the valley floor. Several typical farmsteads from the 18th and 19th centuries characterize the place."

Once at the top, a panoramic section continues all the way to the summit. The view extends over the alpine chain with the Mont Blanc, the lakes of Neuch\u00e2tel and Geneva, the D\u00f4le region and the Chasseral.

After leaving the forest behind you, it is worth looking back at the rock wall of Aiguilles de Baulmes. The climb to Le Suchet starts after Grange Neuve. You really should not miss the five-minute detour to the summit, to take another look back at the peaks along the Jura Crest Trail. ",
            "As you descend to Le Suchet chalet, you can enjoy the sweeping views of Lake Neuch\u00e2tel, the plain and even the Alps in the distance. The downhill walk takes about two hours, through enchanting Jura meadows until you reach Ballaigues. You come closer and closer to the steep rock walls (falaises) of the Mont d\u2019Or, towering about 200 meters high. A little way outside of Ballaigues, you can discover a historic cart track (Roman road). It resembles a tramway track but instead of iron rails, the carts were guided along grooves that were driven into the rock base. In the mid-19th century, sought-after salt was transported via this route from the French saltworks to Bern and western Switzerland. The village of Ballaigues, the finish of the stage, is located on the southern slope of the Suchet range, high above the course of the Orbe river."

The Rheinfall (Rhine Falls), Switzerland's most visited tourist attraction, is on the ViaRhenana.",

Especially attractive are the cruises between Konstanz and Schaffhausen or Rheinfelden and Basel, which offer the ideal return trip after a hike."

It is also possible that the interaction of various forces led to this natural phenomenon, such as the tectonic position, glaciation, lime erosion and a spring with a stream. At various places you can enjoy the beautiful view over the valley of Saint-Imier, the Combe Gr\u00e8de nature reserve or the Chasseral with its famous 155-metre-high television antenna.

            "The challenging loop trail begins at the Montbovon train station and wanders up and down through a wild and pristine landscape. After the lovely church of Montbovon and the old buildings, one of which an inn from the 18th century, the path leads to the hydroelectric power plant on Lake Lessoc. From there the walk continues via Route du Lac slightly uphill on a paved road.",
            "After about 2 km the trail begins to climb in the direction of La Petite Chia, an alpine hut at an altitude of 1,060 m. Steep trails (solid footwear is a must) are leading through a dense and pleasant forest to an area of gentle pastures. A fountain at the Sonlomont alpine hut offers a water break. This might also be a good time to fill up the water bottles before the final ascent. The path follows the ridge forming the border between Canton Fribourg and Canton Vaud and leads back into the forest. From there it climbs up to the La Br\u00e2 alpine hut at 1,460 m, high above the Intyamon Valley. Volunteer herdsmen are tending the cattle here during the summer. It is a lovely place to rest your feet and enjoy the fantastic views.",
            "The descent is about 1 km long and passes through pastures and meadows. Time and again, you will have amazing views of the Intyamon Valley and the villages of Albeuve and Neirivue. After Les Ciernettes the path becomes challenging and snakes through the forest in the direction of the \u201cVerbuts\u201d in Lessoc. There are two picnic spots on Le Torrent creek, one with a grilling station, at an altitude of 870 m. A gently descending path leads to Lake Lessoc (follow the trail signs to Montbovon) and the historic covered bridge which was built in 1667. It crosses the Saane River and is one of the oldest, but most importantly, one of the last of its type in the Canton Fribourg. The stone bridge of Lessoc on the hiking trail, now paved, is another witness of history. After a little while, you will come to a grilling station with a bench, a welcome place to enjoy the peaceful Lac de Lessoc area. The trail now hugs the lakeshore and continues to offer outstanding views. After four hours the hydroelectric power plant comes into view again on the left before the tour ends at the Montbovon train station."

            "The Werenbachtobel is one of the most impressive landscapes among Z\u00fcrich's gorges. It has emerged over the course of the last 10000 to 15000 years where the Linth glacier retreated from the Z\u00fcrich area towards the end of the last ice age. A short detour to the old mill wheel is always worth the effort, whilst the two inns invite us to linger a little while. The locality of Trichtenhusen was first documented in the year 946, and its mill has been in existence since 1417.",
            "The brook that meanders through St\u00f6ckentobel is known as Elefantenbach and is symbolized by the stone elephant, which the Z\u00fcrich Beautification Association of 1898 built further downstream in the brook bed. Where the unusual name comes from is not clear but maps of the area from the years 1843-1851 show the name of the brook flowing through the St\u00f6ckentobel as \u00abElephantenbach\u00bb. The elephant is in the middle of the brook and invites us to stop and play for a while. A campfire site with seating is also available."

This is where Aromat (a condiment) is manufactured. Another special feature: the commune has a longer border with Germany than with Switzerland. You follow the German border along the river Biber as far as Bibern. The \"Beauty of Bibern\" is not a lady, but a variety of plum.

The hike takes you along smugglers' paths to the northernmost inhabited area of Switzerland, the Egghof above Sottenegg near Altdorf. Despite the northern latitude, vines have flourished here since Roman times. However, Switzerland's northernmost vineyard was only planted in 1972, and the route takes you directly past it. You should sample Riesling and Pinot Noir, which flourish on this calcareous clay soil. After you pass the Hegi biotope with its dragonflies and amphibian species, a unique view of the Hegau region (in Germany) awaits you above Opfertshofen: extinct volcanoes on the horizon, the Swiss Alps as the backdrop, and an untouched natural region at your feet. You will cherish these impressions as you return to Thayngen."

            "Eggiwil is located in the upper part of the Emmental valley. Typical Emmental inns characterise the village. The hiking trail follows the Emme for the first few minutes, then leaves the course of the river at Untere Brach. Climbing uphill on paths and a paved road, you reach Ober Steinboden after an ascent of 400 metres, followed by Hinder R\u00e4misgumme. The small farm is situated on the border of the Unesco Biosphere Entlebuch. The \"Wild West of Lucerne\" is known for its alpine pastures, untouched moorland, the wildly rugged Schrattenfluh or the Brienzer Rothorn, which is probably one of the most beautiful vantage points in Switzerland. ",
            "The Schrattenfluh, a mountain range of about six kilometres, is now located directly in front of you. On the other side you can see the extensive, mostly vegetation-free karst fields of the Schratten limestone. The numerous caves and furrows are the result of erosion processes, since the rain immediately seeps into the subsoil through the porous rock ledges. A short time later, you reach Pfyffer at 1316 m.a. s. l. From here and up to Wachthubel, the Napfbergland border trail uses the same route as the Trans Swiss Trail. Now the Hohgant, also known as the crown of the Emmental, emerges into view. After a gentle up and down hike, the highest point of the stage is reached an hour later at 1414 m.a. s. l.. The Wachthubel with its breathtaking panoramic view invites you to take a longer break. ",
            "Now follows the approximately one-hour descent to Schangnau, the destination of the hike. The village is located at the top of the Emmental on the border to the Bernese Oberland, surrounded by striking mountain ranges. The population is still widely involved in agriculture and dairy farming. The water buffalo are a speciality here. Their milk is very rich, containing about twice as much protein and fat as cow's milk, whereas the cholesterol content of buffalo meat is half that of beef. Both are consumed here without long transport routes."

In view on the first section: the protected, alpine moor landscape of Halserberg/Betelberg. Before the mountain trail narrows and the first ascent begins, it is worth stopping for a break at the Steinstoss alp which you will pass again on the way back. ",
            "The following easy ascent runs along the south side of the St\u00fcbleni limestone formation, the highest point of the hike. On a clear day, you can enjoy a fantastic panoramic view: from the Simmental over the Saanenland to the mountain gems of Fribourg. The \"St\u00fcbleni\" (small rooms) refer to the individual \"craters\" in the Gryden area, whereby \"Gryde\" probably comes from Chride (chalk). But how did this unique area in Switzerland, which fascinates geologists, biologists and hikers alike, come into being? The rain gradually dissolves the almost white, relatively soft gypsum rock. The water carves holes in it, but continues to flow underground, creating a system of gypsum karst with cavities. When one of these collapses, the sinkholes become visible on the surface. In the St\u00fcbleni area, these seepage funnels are particularly numerous. ",
            "The trail winds downhill past the sinkholes towards the turning point of the circular hike. A detour to the refuge is worthwhile here: take a break and enjoy the moon-like crater landscape before heading back. Those who do this additional loop should be sure-footed and free from vertigo. This time you pass the \"St\u00fcbleni\" to the north. From there, the trail descends steadily to Steinstoss, after which there is only about one kilometre left to reach the starting point."

Thanks to the resistance of Russian general Bagration, however, the train was able to make its way unimpeded into the valley. An army of over 15,000 men marched up the bumpy mule track to Elm, with only shreds of their uniforms clinging to their emaciated bodies. Not even the officers had intact footwear, and much of the army went barefoot. ",

The snow swirled from the sky in thick flakes. With General Molitor breathing down his neck, the 70-year-old Suvorov took up quarters in Elm's most stately home, the residence of Glarus bailiff Freitag, who had died in August 1799.",

Between the ar\u00eate and St Iddaburg, the deep gorge of the Murg gapes open with its jagged rock faces. From Ottenegg, the far-reaching view opens up over Lake Constance and the Hegau volcanic landscape.",

Next, we pass the huge stone quarry, where gneiss is excavated to this day, arriving in Arvigo with its 16th century stone bridge. From here, it is worth taking a side trip to the picturesque, car-free village of Braggio, situated on a magnificent sun terrace high above.

There are eight of these in total. These historical artificial water channels have been used for centuries. They carry water from mountain springs to the fields and pastures of the arid Rhone Valley. Due to its scarcity, the use of water was strictly regulated. This was often the cause of conflicts if farmers used too much water to irrigate their fields. It took experience to moisten the pastures with water from the bisses. Just the right amount of water had to be fed into the pasture, and if this was too much, landslides could occur. ",

The H\u00fcttnersee is an idyllic lake set in the landscape of Mor\u00e4nenh\u00fcgell. The depression into which it is set was formed at the end of the last ice age by one side of the Linth glacier. The lake is also popular for swimming, other short stays and its small public beach.",

The pre-Alpine waters of the River Sihl wind towards Z\u00fcrich, swerving past large rocky mounds, creating a gorge-like environment whilst providing hikers with an easy route to the Finsterseebr\u00fccke bridge. The last small waterway on this hike is Teufenbachweiher, a reservoir. This serves the oldest power plant in the Canton of Z\u00fcrich, the EW Waldhalde an der Sihl, by means of a pressure pipe."

On the other side of the valley, continue on a gravel road through the well-kept countryside into the forest. Here, on the slopes of the Piz Mezdi, you will find several natural caves. The people of the surrounding villages took refuge in them when General Baldiron conquered the Lower Engadine for the Habsburgs in a bloody campaign in September 1622. The boulders are overgrown with moss, and many caves are ice-covered. The ground here is unpredictable, as you can sink deep on the rotten trunks and in the moss.",

Invigorated by the delicious meal, we climb up the mountain trail to the village of Chez-le-Bol\u00e9.

            "At the end, there is an opportunity for a tour to the ruins of Spiegelberg castle. In the Middle Ages, a fortress was built on the razor-sharp ridge by the Lords of Spiegelberg. Because the drop of the hillsides is almost vertical, the fortress was believed to be unassailable at that time. Today a refuge hut is located at the same place. It\u2019s a good idea to take a break up here: The Somm\u00eatre ridge is one of the breeziest and most scenic spots in the Canton Jura with a marvellous view over the Doubs Valley, to France and of part of the Freiberge Mountains.

A short time later, the river makes an abrupt change of direction. This may also be the reason why the Romans once called the meandering river the Doubs.

The population of this strictly protected species, which is only found in the catchment area of the Rhone, was estimated at 50 to 150 adult specimens in 2012. At the next loop, you change to a small path. After about one and a half hours, the campsite with its restaurant by the name of Tariche is located on the other side of the river. Here, you can cross the Doubs under your own steam by means of a winch and a skiff. ",

A little later, the scenic path turns into a paved road. Passing \"Bief du Moulin\", the three mills, of which only one remains, you reach the village of Soubey a little later after just under four hours hiking time. The village centre is characterised by old houses dating from the 17th to 19th centuries. The Saint-Valbert parish church, built in 1632, is the only Swiss church north of the alps with a roof made of limestone slabs."

The date of work is uncertain (1010-1100) but it is most certainly one of Ticino's most ancient and is often studied by researchers of the great Romanesque paintings of Northern Italy.",

In the lower part, curtains conceal the original decoration evoked by the emerging dragon's head. On both sides, Santo Stefano and Santa Caterina.

The main thread of the apse paintings is the Life of the Virgin, developed around the central fresco depicting \"Mary's Coronation\". In the dividing arches, the \"Assumption of the Virgin\" assisted by the Apostles and musician angels. Under the arches, Prophets and Saint Anthony the Abbot.",

            "Piazza Grande was built in the 700s thanks to the retraction of the lakefront that in ancient times brushed the houses. The typical pavement of river cobblestones dates from 1825.",
            "Start the walk by crossing the entire square to the Visconti Castle. Of ancient origins, it was conquered by the Visconti family of Milan in 1342 and later enlarged. In 1532, after the victory of the Confederates against the Milanese, it was for the most part demolished and from the existing five towers, only one was salvaged. The castle is home of the Archaeological Museum with a remarkable collection of Roman glass found in excavations in the region, including the famous \"bird chalice\".",
            "Past the church you should go up the stairway along the western side of the castle that leads to the Citt\u00e0 Vecchia. Once you reach the top, walk along the Ripa Canova to the widening where, on the left, is located the church of San Francesco (Saint Francis) close to the namesake convent. The church's current building, although traditionally known to be from 1316, was built in 1583 with stones from the part of the castle destroyed by the Confederates. The interior of the triple-aisled church, with precious frescoes, was restored between 2009 and 2012. San Francesco hosts numerous Classical music concerts during the prestigious Settimane Musicali di Ascona (Ascona Music Weeks). The adjacent convent of the Friars Minor was transformed into a school at the end of the 1800s.",

At the entrance of the hospital stands a large bronze sculpture, masterpiece of artist Nag Arnoldi.

Inside the church you can admire precious frescoes from different authors. The most outstanding, from 1401, are works of a not-better-specified \"Master of Saint Mary\" and are considered between the best examples of the international Gothic style in Lombard territory. Located in the central part of the oriental lunette are representations of \"Our Lady of Clemency\" (above) and the \"Coronation of the Virgin\" and groups of Saints, Martyrs and Prophets, located in the ribs of the vault. Other frescoes are works of Giacobino da Vitale (The Virgin's Funeral - 1450), the ",

On the square are the namesake church, partially rebuilt in the 19th century, and the Casa Rusca, a noble 17th century house and headquarter of the Pinacoteca comunale (Communal Art Gallery). After crossing the square, take the narrow Via S. Antonio that between antiques and handicrafts stores leads to the Piazzetta delle Corporazioni and then turn left in Via Cittadella, the central artery of the Citt\u00e0 Vecchia. Located here is the church of Santa Maria Assunta (Saint Mary Assunta) - also called the Chiesa Nuova (New Church). Built around 1630, a stucco sculpture representing San Cristoforo (Saint Christopher) decorates the facade. The interior presents one of the most sumptuous Baroque stucco decorations in Ticino.",

If you turn right, you will walk through the porticos to Via Ramogna and, beyond, to the train station behind which you can see the Romanesque church San Vittore, that is considered one of the most important ones in Ticino.",
            "The current building dates back to 1100 but its bell tower is from the 500s. It is well-known thanks to the frescoes in the central aisle representing scenes from the Genesis: from the Expulsion from Paradise to the Curse of Cain. The paintings, that are better observed with binoculars, are unique for the choice of themes, forms and colors. They unravel along a strip about 2 meters wide and around 20 in length. Dating from around 1140-1150, they are some of Ticino's oldest. Of great value are the 22 capitals of the columns that sustain the crypt, decorated with a succession of geometric and plant motifs, human heads and fantastic animals forming an extraordinary collection of Romanesque sculptures.",

Surrounding the little church dedicated to Saint Anne stand old rural and noblemen's homes.

Over the centuries the inhabitants abandoned the old village and moved to the one we know today. The reason for this move is intriguing and is related to emigration. In 1631, after about fifty Bergamese and Valtellina laborers quit their jobs at the Livorno border, some emigrants from Rasa together with others from Palagnedra, Ronco and Terree di Pedemonte, were fortunate to take their place marking the beginning of an era of prosperity and well-being in the little town of Rasa. In fact, those emigrants built elegant houses and financed religious buildings in the village's new abode located on a plain in a beautiful position. The church of Saint Anne dates back to the first half of the 1700s.",

From 1997 to 2001 the building was entirely restructured by the renowned Ticino architect ",

            "The Vincenzo Vela Museum collections reflect the specificity of the home-museum of a man, Vincenzo Vela, who was actively engaged in his time, both as an artist and as a patriot. In the midst of approximately 5'000 works what stands out is his plaster casts gallery, that surprises for its quality and monumental nature and which gathers original plaster models of most of his sculptures. Next to it you can admire terracotta and plaster drafts, that amaze for their fineness and completeness.",
            "The inheritance also includes over a thousand prints and drawings of which many by Vela himself, and a surprising collection of old photographs. These (about a thousand) represent one of the oldest collections of Swiss photography. ",

            "By painter Spartaco Vela, son of Vincenzo and donor of the Villa to the Swiss Confederation, many oil paintings in addition to preparatory and academic sketches are present. ",
            "The three artists of the Vela family were also collectors of contemporary art of that era, each following their personal taste and taking advantage of their respective friendships with colleagues and friends from the Academy. The three units, converging in the patrimony of the museum, hence form the largest collection of 19th century Lombardy and Piedmont paintings owned by the Swiss Confederation.",

            "Rightly considered benefactors of their community of origin, Ligornetto, the two most outstanding members of the Vela family, the artists Lorenzo and Vincenzo, came from humble origins. The father Giuseppe Vela (1780-1849) was a peasant, the mother Teresa Casanova (1782-1866) ran a tavern. Like many youth from the Mendrisio region, the two Vela brothers started working stone in the caves of Bisazio, Viaggi\u00f9 and Saltrio. Blessed with a unique talent, they achieved fame in nearby Milan, that welcomed Ticino's youth on the construction site of the Duomo or in the classrooms of the Brera Academy.",
            "The two sculptors never broke contact with their native town, demonstrating their attachment through generous gifts to the Ligornetto Commune. Lorenzo was one of the founders of the Societ\u00e0 di Mutuo Soccorso (1889) (Mutual Rescue Society) while Spartaco, the only son of Vincenzo and last direct descendant of the family who died at a young age, followed his father's wishes donating his villa and the collections preserved within to the Swiss Confederation, determining it as the perfect asset to become a museum and fine arts academy. If on the one hand the three artists' faith in liberal politics guaranteed commissions from and favoured attendance of the Italian Risorgimento and progressive environments, both in Lombardy as well as in Ticino, on the other hand their beliefs caused sour hostilities from Ticino conservatives who considered them anticlerical.",

            "At 7:15 am on April 25th 1986 an avalanche struck the village of Mogno in the Maggia Valley destroying the 17th century church of San Giovanni Battista (Saint John the Baptist). A commission for the church's reconstruction was formed and the project given to the architect Mario Botta. A lot of controversy surrounded the project and its realization. Nevertheless, Botta built one of his most important works in Mogno. The church that we see today is the answer that underlines \"the positivity of construction as an expression of the toils of humankind\" when faced with nature's devastating force, affirms Botta.\n                                ",

            "Construction began in 1992 and extended over a period of 4 years. The new church is erected in the same position as the former one and has the same orientation. The height (17 meters) corresponds to that of the old bell tower. The churchyard substitutes the cemetery. The ossuary was rebuilt in the exact same position. The two church bells, from 1746, are the only elements that could be reclaimed from the church that was wiped away by the avalanche.",
            "The image of the ruins, related to the mass of snow that destroyed the old monument as well as part of the village, \"surfaces once again in the decided inclined 'cut' of the outer walls \u2013 explains Mario Botta \u2013 which compress the internal space and force it to expand towards the sky by way of the roof-cum-skylight. The subtle dualism between the levity of the roofing and the strength and thickness of the building, completely new compared to the consistency of a traditional stone roof, testify to the desire for survival on the part of the construction.\"",
            "The plan of the previous building describes a basic rectangle inscribed within an ellipse, which is transformed into a circle corresponding to the roofing. \"The exiguity of the size \u2013 describes again the architect \u2013 is made up for the geometrical synthesis between the figures of the rectangle, the ellipsis and the circle with an entire series of which the ascent of the human dimension, represented in the regular space of the base, to the divine perfection suggested in the circular roofing\".",
            "The walls of the church are 2 meters thick progressively tapering to 50 centimeters at the summit. \"The construction technique \u2013 explains Botta \u2013 is based on the tradition, highlighting the use of stone not as a covering but having structural valences to be seen in the rediscovery of dry-laid stone building, by way of blocks with cavities filled with cement.

            "These distinctive features are certainly what attract today's visitors but what have also made the living of Brontallo residents laborious. For centuries, men, women and children have labored up here, always with a conical wicker basket on their shoulders, always in movement up or down, from the village to the mountains; to the mountain pastures from the bottom of the valley where a road was already built around 1820 but was not connected to the village before 1955; from the right slope of the valley to the left where mountains and mountain pastures are also located.",

            ", San Bernardino, Nufenen) is the reason why around the year 400 an important defensive project with three castles, towers and city walls was built. The Dukes of Milan were the ones to block the valley of the River Ticino. It was meant to impede the Swiss Confederates from gaining ground in the South. This passage, at the valley's narrowing point, is the only access to the North.",

Castelgrande, that in the 80s and 90s was subject to an accurate restoration directed by the architect Aurelio Galfettti, is equipped with two high towers and crenulated walls that are partially accessible on foot. It houses a museum illustrating the history of the city as well as temporary exhibits, and a good restaurant managed by the Canton Ticino Tourism School.",
            "The site on which Castelgrande stands is rich in history and archaeological findings unearthed during excavations in 1984-85 confirm that the site was inhabited as far back as the Neolithic period (5500-5000 B.C.) and date back to Roman times. Excavations in 1967 brought to light evidence of the first fortification from the 4th century A.C. Documents dating from the 6th century. also mention the existence of this first defensive construction. The castle as we see it today was built in various stages and has undergone several restorations. The castle construction began in the 13th century; it was enlarged in 1473-86 and later restored in the 17th and 19th centuries. The White and Black Tower date from the 13th and 14th centuries and are respectiverly 27 and 28 meters high. ",
            "Architect Mr. Aurelio Galfetti carried out the latest extensive restorations in 1984-1991. The inner courtyard, the entrances, the elevator and the steps leading down to the town center are a stunning exemplification of the castle\u2019s transformation. ",
            "The battlements are divided into three sections, one of which still descends right into the town center. At the time of the Visconti, this remaining bulwark reached down as far as the river Ticino. It was built in the late 14th century and fortified by the Sforza dukes of Milan between 1486 and 1489. In 1515 parts of the wall were destroyed by a terrible flood.",
            "The elengance of the 27-metre-high White Tower (1250-1350) and the impressiveness of the 28-metre-high Black Tower (1310) are also worth mentioning. In the Black Tower you can play with an amusing \"Escape Room\" dedicated to the Rabadan Carnival, Bellinzona's historic event, which is one of Switzerland's largest carnival events.",

            "Montebello is the name of the hill on which the castle stands, 90 meters above Castelgrande. The defensive walls of the old town originate here and join up with those from San Michele hill. There are still parts of both branches of these walls protecting the north and south sides of the fortress. The internal nucleus of the castle dates back to the 13th/14th century and has been restored several times.",
            "Most probably, it was built by the Rusca family of Como who kept it for a long period of time, even during the rule of the Viscontis. The external courtyards with the towers and the \"Rivellino\" were built by Sforza-engineers in the second half of the 15th century During Swiss occupation, the castle was called Castello di Svitto but it was renamed Castello di San Martino when Ticino became an independent canton. Towards the end of the 18th century, the castle was acquired by the Ghiringhelli family who ceded it to the Canton in 1903 on the occasion of the first centenary of independence. ",

            "The third castle, Sasso Corbaro, dominates the city from above enjoying a spectacular view. It can be reached both from Montebello by following the stretches of trails through the vineyards and the stretches of road, accessible also by car. It houses exhibition halls and an excellent restaurant. ",
            "The Sforzas built the third castle, called Sasso Corbaro after the hill on which it stands, in 1479 after the defeat of the Milanese troops at the Battle of Giornico. It was designed and completed in the incredibly brief time of 6 months by the military engineer Benedetto Ferrini of Florence who died of the plague shortly before its completion. Its dominant position, 230 meters above the town, meant better protection of the Ticino Valley. The Castle, starkly geometrical in shape, stands in a square courtyard enclosed by high walls which are as much as 7 meters thick at the point where they join the keep on the northern side. In the square courtyard enclosed by high walls is the donjon (or keep) with its mighty walls reaching 7 metres in thickness.",
            "The lookout tower on the southern side is still almost intact. During early Swiss occupation, the castle was known as the Castle of Unterwalden but was renamed Castle of Santa Barbara in 1818. Today it is called Sasso Corbaro or Castello di Cima.",
            "It was abandoned in 1798 and started to deteriorate. It would have fallen into complete disrepair had the Canton not interceded in 1870, handing it over to an organization, which planned to turn it into a hotel, and later to three Bellinzona-families who transformed it into a summer residence. In 1919, the state regained possession of the castle and began a restoration that included the rebuilding of the \"Rivellino\" (or outer courtyard), the entrance gates, the 17th century chapel and the well.

His goal was to build an environment capable of housing the richest collection of precious exotic plants, in compliance with the biological features of each species, while simultaneously satisfying both aesthetic and botanical requirements. Following its purchase, the property was readapted, with terracing and excavation works, in order to accommodate the park of his dreams. The cultivations that required shade and shelter from the wind were placed in a protected, artificial valley, while the ones that needed sunlight were planted in the park\u2019s terraced gardens. A special pumping system, designed to drain water directly from the lake thanks to a pipeline measuring 8km in length, was built in order to guarantee an adequate water supply. ",

From the description, the place seemed ideal to fulfill the Captain\u2019s life-long dream, namely the creation of one of the world\u2019s most beautiful botanical parks.

Neil visited Italy for the first time at the tender age of eight, docking in Livorno during a cruise on his father\u2019s yacht. According to him, it was a question of love at first sight. Even while studying at Eton and Oxford, he used to spend his holidays \u2013 as was customary for members of the elite \u2013 on the Mediterranean, painting Italian landscapes. He went on his first trip around the world aged just sixteen, repeating the experience five more times throughout his life, trawling the four corners of the earth in search of rare and unknown plant species to show and spread across Europe \u2013 and, most importantly, to display at his marvelous gardens surrounding Villa Taranto, where he lived until the year of his death in1964, aged 80.",

            "The hike to the Tremorgio and Le\u00ect alpine lakes above Rodi-Fiesso (940 meters) in Leventina Valley is a particularly fascinating excursion for those who love alpine environments. In just a few minutes, the cable car (operating from June to October) takes you from the village of Rodi-Fiesso right up to the Tremorgio hut (1850 meters): a 900 metre ascent which allows you to save a lot of energy. On reaching the top, you will be offered a fabulous view of the lake whose waters have been used for nearly a century to produce electricity. In autumn 2012, the Carlo Danzi Foundation promoted and funded the construction of a trail that allows you to walk around the lake: an easy, 3-km hike along flat ground, which takes about 40 minutes. Local products and hot meals can be enjoyed at the hut during the summer.",
            "On the other hand the vast plain of Alpe Campolungo (2100 metres), crossed by a crystal-clear stream, can be reached in less than an hour\u2019s walk from the cable car arrival station. An idyllic place, rich in minerals, studied by many researchers. During summer, the meadows abound in lush vegetation, and flowering shrubs add a touch of colour to the landscape. Here you can admire gentians, anemones, rhododendrons, buttercups, columbines as well as many other flowering species.",
            "While climbing up to Lake Le\u00ect (\u201cLe\u00ect\u201d meaning \"small lakes\" in Leventina dialect), which can be reached in about 45 minutes, the pasture gives way to rock. The landscape changes appearance and is dominated by the magnificent Pizzo Prevat silhouetted against the sky. It is a much-loved summit often tackled by mountain climbers who test their skills on this demanding ascent. The Leit Hut is the perfect place to take a pit stop, enjoying simple dishes including polenta served with regional alpine cheeses.",
            "Hikers will have to walk for another 45 minutes along a fairly steep, rather challenging path, before coming upon another hidden treasure, namely Lake Varozzeira (2400 metres), boasting a beautiful, almost purple colour. ",
            "Overall, allow about two hours to get to Lake Le\u00ect from Tremorgio (just under three hours to Lake Varozzeira).",
            "Anyone wishing to try their hand at a more challenging hike, or stay in the area overnight, can take the three-and-a-half hour climb up to the Campo Tencia Hut (the first hut built in the Ticino Alps, it was opened in 1912) and the eponymous Pizzo Campo Tencia, which, standing at a height of 3701 metres, is the highest peak in the Ticino area (calculate around 3 hours from the hut)",
            "Inaugurated in the summer of 2016, the geo-tourism trail of Campolungo comprises two routes, a flatter one skirting Lake Tremorgio, and a more challenging one that leads to the Leit Hut. The educational panels erected along the path provide interesting information about  the geology, hydrology, mineralogy and the flora and fauna of the region.\n                                "

On reaching the summit, you will be met by a panoramic view, not only of the lake but also of the Alpine chain dominated by the imposing Monte Rosa, as well as the charming villages of the Centovalli, in Switzerland, and of the Valle Vigezzo, beyond the border.",
