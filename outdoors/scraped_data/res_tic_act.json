In 1631, after about fifty Bergamese and Valtellina laborers quit their jobs at the Livorno border, some emigrants from Rasa together with others from Palagnedra, Ronco and Terree di Pedemonte, were fortunate to take their place marking the beginning of an era of prosperity and well-being in the little town of Rasa.

This is the vision that inspired Captain Neil Boyd McEacharn, an academic and a member of the Royal Company of Archers, to create this magnificent 20-hectare park in 1931, a perfect example of an English Garden in Italy. His goal was to build an environment capable of housing the richest collection of precious exotic plants, in compliance with the biological features of each species, while simultaneously satisfying both aesthetic and botanical requirements. Following its purchase, the property was readapted, with terracing and excavation works, in order to accommodate the park of his dreams. The cultivations that required shade and shelter from the wind were placed in a protected, artificial valley, while the ones that needed sunlight were planted in the park’s terraced gardens. A special pumping system, designed to drain water directly from the lake thanks to a pipeline measuring 8km in length, was built in order to guarantee an adequate water supply.

Among others, visitors can admire magnolias, eucalypti, rare tropical plants, lotus flowers, chestnut trees, birches, tulips, dahlias, Indian paintbrushes, azaleas, narcissi, rhododendrons, hydrangeas as well as several exceptional specimens of beech trees. While strolling along the paths of the park you will come across terraces, turfs, waterfalls and ponds.", "It was 1931 when Captain Neil Boyd McEacharn read an advertisement in the London \"Times\" stating that the Marquise of Sant’Elia intended to sell her estate “La Crocetta” in Pallanza, on Lake Maggiore. From the description, the place seemed ideal to fulfill the Captain’s life-long dream, namely the creation of one of the world’s most beautiful botanical parks. He had already tackled a similar challenge with the renovation of the vast park of Galloway House, his family’s castle in Scotland. Negotiations with the Marquise of Sant’Elia were concluded shortly thereafter and reconstruction began in 1931.", "Neil Boyd McEacharn came from a wealthy Scottish family. Not only was his father an Anglo-Australian shipping magnate, but his wife’s family also owned rich iron and coal mines in Australia, as well as a vast sheep farming estate, boasting over one million sheep, thereby guaranteeing the import of wool into England. Neil visited Italy for the first time at the tender age of eight, docking in Livorno during a cruise on his father’s yacht. According to him, it was a question of love at first sight. Even while studying at Eton and Oxford, he used to spend his holidays – as was customary for members of the elite – on the Mediterranean, painting Italian landscapes. He went on his first trip around the world aged just sixteen, repeating the experience five more times throughout his life, trawling the four corners of the earth in search of rare and unknown plant species to show and spread across Europe – and, most importantly, to display at his marvelous gardens surrounding Villa Taranto, where he lived until the year of his death in1964, aged 80.", "His remains are housed in a chapel-mausoleum expressly built in the gardens.", "In 1938, Neil Boyd McEacharn donated the park to the Italian State, maintaining life estate.

The church dates back to the 14th century and is decorated with beautiful frescos (visits can be arranged).", "Following the indicated trail, you will be lead down to the bridge Punt da Canaa. Along the way you can observe rocks that are clearly stratified: they are the park's most ancient ones (190 million year-old flint limestone). Your will then be led to cross a deep and narrow gorge by means of a recently built bridge and proceed onto the right bank. You will still be surrounded by the layers of rock, crossing some singular biotopes, and will finally return to the Ghitello mill where more recent deposits are visible (Tertiary and Quaternary).", "Upon request, the Park organizes guided tours and educational activities specifically for schools, whereas in the summer the local tourist office offers tours to the public.", "Offered only as a guided tour, it is possible to follow another itinerary in the Park of the Breggia Gorge but it is rather difficult to combine it with the first option. The Cement course is the most visible element of ex-cement factory Saceba's redevelopment, located at the entrance of the Breggia Gorge and part of the namesake geological park. In 1972-1973, during the period of peak production, Saceba produced up to 200'000 tons of cement a year for a total of over 2 million tons in approximately 20 years of activity.", "The educational tour uses the structures of the old factory to illustrate the transformation process of rock into cement. The itinerary takes place along a 2 km trail: from the open air caves to the tunnels used to extract the material, to the mill where the rock was ground and ending at the oven towers, the heart of the cement factory used today as an exhibit and educational space.", "The temperature in the tunnels is cool (10-13°C) and humidity high (over 80%). It is therefore recommended to dress appropriately. Helmets, headlamps and reflective jackets are provided on the spot. It's an easy walk although not recommended for people suffering from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, claustrophobia, epilepsy or other serious handicaps.\n                                "]},

This is where a fairly easy up-and-down path begins following the mountain crest through peaks, slopes and pastures, finally reaching Monte Lema in the Malcantone (1,620 m). During the entire trail, the view opens up to the North onto Lake Maggiore, Centovalli, Verzasca Valley, Maggia Valley, Locarno and Bellinzona, while to the South you can sight Lugano with its valleys and lake. Sticking out in the distance are also the most majestic peaks of the Alps, like the Monte Rosa and the Matterhorn.", "It is an itinerary straddled between Ticino and Italy that lasts about 5 hours and that requires some training, not because of the difficulty (it is classified T2) but for its duration. From Monte Lema you can go down to Miglieglia with a comfortable cableway. Room and board are available at Alpe Foppa, Monte Tamaro and Monte Lema. You should foresee a good amount of water because the itinerary is poor in water sources and streams. The equipment must be apt for a mountain excursion.", "The walk can also be undertaken in the opposite direction.

Each of these are at about an hour walk away from each other and after passing them you then reach the Monti di Sant’Abbondio and Monti di Caviano (known as Centocampi, or \"A Hundred Fields\") – the only place in Ticino where you can find hay roof houses. Little by little as the farming activities were abandoned, these buildings fell to ruin but a few years ago the local tourist office invested in restoring some of the roofs using the traditional technique.

From Dirinella it is also possible to return by bus to Magadino and then take the boat from there to Locarno.

The Cianis enlarged and refurbished the existing building while, in parallel, they started building the park. They soon faced a difficult problem: periodic flooding of the property, caused both by the overflow of the Cassarate river and the lake into the parkland. The problem was resolved by building a containment wall and by raising the property by one and a half meters above the lake surface. In 1912 the villa and the park were purchased by the city of Lugano.\n                                "]}
